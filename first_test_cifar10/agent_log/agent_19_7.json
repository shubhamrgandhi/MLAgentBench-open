Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\n2. **Select Hyperparameters and Architectures:**\n   - Choose a range of hyperparameters and model architectures to experiment with. For example, you could try different learning rates, batch sizes, and momentum values for a specific model architecture.\n\n3. **Create Experimental Setup:**\n   - Set up an experimental environment where you can easily train and evaluate different models. This could involve using a cloud computing platform or a local machine with the necessary software and libraries.\n\n4. **Train and Evaluate Models:**\n   - Train each model with the selected hyperparameters and architecture. Evaluate the performance of each model using the chosen evaluation metrics.\n\n5. **Analyze Results:**\n   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the ones that achieve the best results. Analyze the impact of different hyperparameters and architectures on the model's performance.\n\n6. **Fine-Tune and Optimize:**\n   - Once you have identified the best performing model, you can further fine-tune its hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This can involve using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization.\n\n7. **Validate Results:**\n   - To ensure that the improved model generalizes well to unseen data, evaluate its performance on a held-out validation set or a test set.\n\nBy conducting these experiments, you can systematically evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters and model architectures on the performance of a model. This will help you identify the best combination of hyperparameters and architecture for your specific task and dataset.\n"
