        ```
        Reflection: 1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**

   - Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and momentum values to optimize the model's performance.
   - Consider using learning rate schedulers to adjust the learning rate during training.
   - Try different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best settings for the given dataset and model architecture.


2. **Model Architecture Exploration:**

   - Investigate different CNN architectures, such as VGGNet, ResNet, or DenseNet, to see if they can achieve better results.
   - Experiment with different activation functions, such as ReLU, Leaky ReLU, or ELU, to improve the model's non-linearity.
   - Try different pooling layers, such as max pooling or average pooling, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
   - Incorporate dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.


3. **Data Augmentation:**

   - Apply data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, rotation, and color jittering, to increase the diversity of the training data.
   - Consider using mixup or CutMix data augmentation methods to further enhance the model's robustness.


4. **Ensemble Methods:**

   - Train multiple models with different hyperparameters or architectures and combine their predictions using techniques like averaging or voting to improve the overall performance.


5. **Regularization Techniques:**

   - Use L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large weights and prevent overfitting.
   - Consider using dropout layers or early stopping to further reduce overfitting.


6. **Transfer Learning:**

   - If a pre-trained model is available for a similar task, consider transferring its weights to the current model and fine-tuning it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This can help the model learn faster and achieve better performance.
