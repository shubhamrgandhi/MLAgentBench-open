===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The script "train.py" exists in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance:
    - Understand the training script train.py and the current model performance.
    - Understand the dataset and the task.
    - Inspect the current model performance.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement:
    - Identify potential hyperparameters to tune.
    - Identify potential model architectures to try.
3. Design and conduct experiments:
    - Design experiments to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters and model architectures.
    - Conduct experiments and analyze the results.
4. Implement the best model:
    - Implement the best model and evaluate its performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv:
    - Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:    
- The script "train.py" exists in the current directory. (directly confirmed)
Thought:    I should inspect the script "train.py" to identify any potential issues.
Action:    Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 1,
    "end_line_number": 10
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 106):

import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torchvision import transforms, datasets
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import torch.nn as nn

# Add data augmentation transforms
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script "train.py" is being inspected to identify any potential issues. The first 10 lines of the script are being examined.

[Action]: The first 10 lines of the script "train.py" are inspected.

[Observation]: The first 10 lines of the script "train.py" import necessary libraries and define a data augmentation transform.
