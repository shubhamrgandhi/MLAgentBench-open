Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   Lines 51-60 define the test_model function, which evaluates the model on a given dataloader. There are no obvious issues in these lines.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance:
    - Understand the training script train.py and the current model performance.
    - Understand the dataset and the task.
    - Inspect the current model performance.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement:
    - Identify potential hyperparameters to tune.
    - Identify potential model architectures to try.
3. Design and conduct experiments:
    - Design experiments to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters and model architectures.
    - Conduct experiments and analyze the results.
4. Implement the best model:
    - Implement the best model and evaluate its performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv:
    - Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:   
- Lines 51-60 define the test_model function, which evaluates the model on a given dataloader. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   
I have inspected the entire script and identified no obvious issues. I should now try running the script to see if it works.
Action:   
Execute Script
Action Input:   
{
    "script_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script train.py was executed to check if it works.
[Action]: The script train.py was executed.
[Observation]: The script train.py failed to execute with the error message: EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.
