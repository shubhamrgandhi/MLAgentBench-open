===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The script failed to execute with an error message "EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.". This error is likely caused by an issue with the environment or the script itself.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance:
    - Understand the training script train.py and the current model performance.
    - Understand the dataset and the task.
    - Inspect the current model performance.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement:
    - Identify potential hyperparameters to tune.
    - Identify potential model architectures to try.
3. Design and conduct experiments:
    - Design experiments to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters and model architectures.
    - Conduct experiments and analyze the results.
4. Implement the best model:
    - Implement the best model and evaluate its performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv:
    - Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:   
- The script failed to execute with an error message "EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.". (directly confirmed)
Thought:   
I should check the environment and the script to identify the cause of the error.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To investigate the error message "EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.", I need to check the files in the current directory to see if there are any clues.
