        [Observation]:
        ```
        **Dataset:**
- CIFAR-10 dataset is used.
- It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

**Task:**
- Image classification.
- The model is trained to predict the class of an image.

**Current Model Performance:**
- The model achieves a training accuracy of 99.26% and a test accuracy of 93.64% after 5 epochs.

**Potential Hyperparameters to Tune:**
- Learning rate (currently set to 0.1)
- Batch size (currently set to 128)
- Number of epochs (currently set to 5)
- Momentum (currently set to 0.9)
