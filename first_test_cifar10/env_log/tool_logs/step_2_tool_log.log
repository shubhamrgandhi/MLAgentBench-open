We are trying to solve this research problem: Given a training script on a dataset train.py, improve upon the current model performance (trained with current hyperparmeters in train.py) for more than 10%. The training epochs should be within 10 to save time. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand the problem and the current model performance. The file train.py contains information about the dataset, task, current model performance, potential hyperparameters to tune, and potential model architectures to try.
[Action]: Understand the file train.py by looking for information about the dataset, task, current model performance, potential hyperparameters to tune, and potential model architectures to try.
[Observation]:
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 dataset is used, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Task: Image classification, where the model is trained to predict the class of an image.
- Current Model Performance: The model achieves a training accuracy of 99.26% and a test accuracy of 93.64% after 5 epochs.
- Potential Hyperparameters to Tune: Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and momentum.
- Potential Model Architectures to Try: Different CNN architectures, activation functions, pooling layers, and dropout rates.

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**

   - Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and momentum values to optimize the model's performance.
   - Consider using learning rate schedulers to adjust the learning rate during training.
   - Try different combinations of hyperparameters to find the best settings for the given dataset and model architecture.


2. **Model Architecture Exploration:**

   - Investigate different CNN architectures, such as VGGNet, ResNet, or DenseNet, to see if they can achieve better results.
   - Experiment with different activation functions, such as ReLU, Leaky ReLU, or ELU, to improve the model's non-linearity.
   - Try different pooling layers, such as max pooling or average pooling, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.
   - Incorporate dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.


3. **Data Augmentation:**

   - Apply data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, rotation, and color jittering, to increase the diversity of the training data.
   - Consider using mixup or CutMix data augmentation methods to further enhance the model's robustness.


4. **Ensemble Methods:**

   - Train multiple models with different hyperparameters or architectures and combine their predictions using techniques like averaging or voting to improve the overall performance.


5. **Regularization Techniques:**

   - Use L1 or L2 regularization to penalize large weights and prevent overfitting.
   - Consider using dropout layers or early stopping to further reduce overfitting.


6. **Transfer Learning:**

   - If a pre-trained model is available for a similar task, consider transferring its weights to the current model and fine-tuning it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This can help the model learn faster and achieve better performance.
