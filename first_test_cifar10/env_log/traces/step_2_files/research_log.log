Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand the problem and the current model performance. The file train.py contains information about the dataset, task, current model performance, potential hyperparameters to tune, and potential model architectures to try.
[Action]: Understand the file train.py by looking for information about the dataset, task, current model performance, potential hyperparameters to tune, and potential model architectures to try.
[Observation]:
- Dataset: CIFAR-10 dataset is used, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Task: Image classification, where the model is trained to predict the class of an image.
- Current Model Performance: The model achieves a training accuracy of 99.26% and a test accuracy of 93.64% after 5 epochs.
- Potential Hyperparameters to Tune: Learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and momentum.
- Potential Model Architectures to Try: Different CNN architectures, activation functions, pooling layers, and dropout rates.
