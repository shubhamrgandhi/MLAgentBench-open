and this is the present for .
great grandma .
it's naima's hand print .
and it says .
n a i m a .
what does that spell ?

elephant ?
does that spell elephant ?
naima's a unusually cranky right now .
you are .
are you hungry ?
do you have a wet diaper ?
i just changed her because she asked me to a little while ago .
i thought you were gonna help wrap presents anyway .
alright .
well .
yeah .
that's what i'm talking about .
ooh ah just calm down .
use your regular voice .
and tell .
what do you wanna ask ?
you can stomp but .
um just .
if you want something you can use your regular voice to ask me .
wasn't working .
okay .
there's naima and we're gonna wrap presents .
alright .
this is gonna go right here .
i'm gonna cut you some paper .
alright ?
you are gonna need some tape .
i think so .
now let's see .
make sure this is gonna be the right size .
let's see .
oh yes that should be enough .
okay .
do you remember how we did it earlier today ?
you fold one end up and then the next end .
yep .
you do it yourself .
this is how you do it .
now fold it down .
by fold you rub .
rub the edge .
see where my finger is ?
rub it with your whole hand .
to make it crease .
good !
and then you fold this half down .
and then make a crease with your hand all the way here .
press down .
let me show you .
let .
slide your hand like that .
there .
okay .
wanna put some tape on ?
okay .
you want another piece ?
good .
here's another one .
you trying to lift it up again ?
yeah i see .
i see .
i made it flat .
here's another piece .
okay .
put a piece right here where this white part is .
but so that it covers the edge of the paper .
alright .
now do you remember what we do next ?
we turn it around .
and then it's time to make the triangles .
there's one triangle .
and now can you fold ?
take the corner .
fold it way up .
way up like that .
good !
you did .
and then you fold the whole thing up .
fold both triangles up .
like that .
and then you tape that part .
and you attach this flap .
this is like a flap isn't it ?
you attach the flap .
to the present with the tape .
and then .
you turn it all the way around gently .
so that this is the edge that you make the triangles on now .
so let's make triangles here .
one here .
well let go for a sec .
take the corner .
bring it up to where the edge of the present inside the wrapping is .
and then what do you do do you remember ?
you bring this edge way up .
okay yeah .
that's right .
yeah and then tape .
let me get my tape .
yeah gotta hold it down .
the main part of the present .
to the big part of the present .
so that the flap stays down .
yep .
okay .
that's on my finger isn't it ?
here .
good .
okay .
you don't need too much just need enough to keep the flap down it doesn't have to be .
well that's okay .
that amount of sticking up is actually okay .
okay .
now .
good job .
turn it so that the tape is on the bottom .
yeah that's the present for grandma it look very nice .
now i'm gonna put this box together to wrap the hat and gloves for grandma .
um okay .
this is what .
the hat i got for my mom .
oh very nice .
and some gloves to match .
the hat is actually .
it's wool but it's lined with fleece so it's not scratchy .
that's very nice .
yes .
i hope .
i hope she will wear it .
and this is .
these are the gloves .
purple gloves .
and i think what i wanna do .
is .
i wanna .
no maybe that won't work .
i guess i'm gonna put the gloves inside the hat .
and then .
wrap it a little bit like this .
and put it in the box .
close up the box .
and then we'll wrap the box in some wrapping paper .
think i'll .
tape the box just a little bit closed .
to make sure it stays closed .
okay can you put that tape right there ?
right here .
right at the edge .
yep and rub it .
so that closes the box .
now we need wrapping paper .
um .
um .
i think we use the gold wrapping paper .
since that seems to be .
okay .
let me see that's not big enough over there so .
yep you're gonna help but let me cut the right size of paper first .
oh the weather outside is frightful .
there is but i'm singing it in the wrong .
with the wrong notes .
because that's a song that i can never remember the right notes to .
okay this is our piece of paper for this box .
do you remember what the first thing we should do is ?
well the first thing we do .
is we make sure the wrapping paper .
the nice side of the wrapping paper the side we want to show is actually on the floor .
this is the inside that no one's gonna see .
the white part .
and then we put our present down on the wrapping paper .
and then we have to do some folding .
do you remember what we do ?
how do we fold the paper ?
okay your end .
you take your end of the paper .
well we don't do the triangles just yet .
take both .
take this in one hand .
and this corner in that hand and bring the .
bring the paper right up here .
onto the box .
not triangles .
just bring all the paper .
right up onto the box .
and that's what i'm gonna do with my end also .
i'm holding this one down .
and now i'm bringing up this paper .
so we're gonna cover .
here's some tape .
cover the box .
with the paper .
yep go ahead and put the tape right there that's good .
and i'll put a piece there and i think we need one more little piece .
right at the end .
good .
nope we actually don't need more there .
the secret to good wrapping is not to use too much tape i think .
now we're gonna make triangles .
this is a box so it's a little different .
our triangle's gonna look like that .
and like that .
now can you bring this up onto the main part of the box ?
pull up and then over .
it's different from wrapping something flat .
okay i'm holding this will you put some tape ?
to attach it .
we don't wanna cover all the edges with tape we just wanna use .
a small .
amount .
teeny tiny pieces of tape .
would you put that one over there ?
good okay .
and i'll put one here .
and now i'm gonna bring it around .
make some triangles on this side .
give you a piece of tape .
don't use it until i tell you okay ?
where's the triangles ?
and then folding it up .
bringing it over .
there .
right on the edge and i'll put one little piece right here too .
and that's done .
well we have a lot more to wrap but we need to make sure we label these and and wrap them with ribbons and things so that .
uh so that we know who they're for .
because that's important too isn't it ?
i wonder if i put all my ribbons and other things in some strange location .
to see if the .
wrapping paper and the ribbons are .
somehow got over here by accident .
well it's not there .
oh i think that's the supper that's ready .
i had a lot of ribbon .
because uh daddy and i um .
put supper in the oven to heat up .
just a second boo boo .
maybe i put it in here .
nope i guess not .
hm .
well that's alright we're just gonna make a little tag for grandma that says .
let's see maybe i'll use the pinking shears .
how about ?
should i make a circle ?
as a tag .
yes circle okay .
and maybe a .
how about if i make a ?
trapezoid for the .
one for your picture .
the tag for your picture .
the one behind you is the one you wrapped .
that's what this is for .
so i'm gonna write so that she knows who it's from it's fer .
for .
for .
grandma .
actually i'm gonna write merry christmas from naima okay ?
is that okay ?
merry .
christmas .
from .
naima .
it says for grandma .
merry christmas .
from naima .
i might add an exclamation point .
okay would you like to tape that ?
to the top of the package there ?
bring your picture over .
take this .
you wanna tape it right on ?
you have two pieces one for each side .
what i mean is one for each edge ?
you can decide where you wanna put it .
decide where on the package you wanna put it .
okay .
here's the other one .
i would put that piece there .
if i were you .
excellent .
that's great .
and this present .
is from all of us .
for .
mom .
and then i'm gonna say parentheses .
grandma .
from .
and then i'm gonna write in parentheses and also .
and naima .
and then i'm gonna tape that .
i'm gonna put my tape on a different way .
i'm gonna fold the tape .
and make it almost like a piece of glue .
so that this becomes like a sticker .
now .
these presents can go under the tree .
wanna put them under the tree ?
and carry them over there ?
you've got a little .
thing here okay .
right over .
bring them over this way .
let me take this diwali thing out of the way .
okay go ahead honey .
and this one too .
great !
okay .
come on back over here .
are you ready to .
i think i'm gonna take a break from wrapping so that we can all have dinner .
would you like to do that ?
okay .
do you think that you could go down and tell daddy that dinner is ready ?
let me take this off you while you do that .
let's go tell daddy that dinner is ready and i'll .
wait where ?
it's still the twenty fourth of december .
might .
be bumpy .
yeah bumpy was .
if it's a road the opposite of flat is bumpy .
the opposite of soft is hard .
well what other adjectives describe things ?
well .
rough and smooth ?
we did rough and smooth .
how about long and short ?
oh long and short .
long is the opposite of short .
like a long time and then a short time .
how about easy and difficult ?
oh those are opposites .
or or ?
delicious and yucky .
i thought the cookies were .
you liked them ?
sleepy bear does too ?
how about ?
flat .
flat and crumpled .
um whole then crumbled .
like the whole thing .
oh hot and cold did you do that ?
cold .
hot .
cold .
the opposite of warm is cool .
the opposite of cool is warm .
how about ?
curly and straight .
the opposite of straight ?
there are many different things .
the opposite of straight is .
curved .
windy .
curly .
curly i almost said curly .
wavy .
like a straight line and a wavy line .
wavy .
those are the major ones .
what do you think the opposite of big is ?
good .
what's the opposite of blue ?
hm ?
there's no opposite of blue .
how about sweet ?
what's the opposite of sweet ?
not really .
well i don't know i would say sour is the opposite of sweet .
oh i would've said bitter .
or bitter .
well you could say that .
and you could say salty .
that's why it's not .
well i don't think salty is the opposite of sweet .
why not ?
because you can have something that's not salty that's unsalted but it's not necessarily sweet .
huh ?
i think so anyway .
well since there are five different tastes .
i know how many tastes there are .
actually six .
i'm aware of that .
but .
i'm aware of that one too but .
i still think sweet .
i don't agree that that can be the opposite of sweet .
well in india it is .
okay .
so .
yeah so i .
there could be .
i could see .
different cultures could .
have various ideas about what the opposite is or whether it has one .
i'll grant you that .
you want a whole camel ?
a whole camel .
yeah .
you know how big camels are ?
they're a lot .
oh you mean a camel cookie .
i thought you meant a camel .
you know what .
you know what you can have a camel cookie but i would like you to have some fruit too .
would you like some apple ?
alright .
a lot of fruit .
actually daddy shoulda had fruit .
daddy can have fruit .
well after three cookies it's sort of .
no i don't think so .
i don't think it's uh .
closing the barn door .
i don't really think of you .
in those particular architectural terms .
what naima ?
daddy ate his cookies they're .
daddy's soy cookies ?
oh daddy's soy cookies they're up in the cabinet .
i ate some of your cookies naima .
naima do you like the peel ?
yeah naima does like the peel .
ah see you didn't used to like it .
well she doesn't like the peel when you cut it up like that .
she likes the peel when she eats an apple .
oh .
whole ?
she likes to chomp at it that way .
oh i see .
would you like some ?
it's good for your teeth .
and .
okay well .
it's fiber .
okay well .
how can i say no ?
thank you .
easily .
if you eat all that apple .
and you're still hungry .
after you eat all that apple .
then you can have camel .
oh i gotta get going now .
uh yeah .
i have a lot of cleaning up to do downstairs .
can you use any help down there daddy ?
no ?
okay .
hm .
here's hoping .
look what just came out of the oven .
naima's cookies .
naima's cookies just came out .
they have to cool down .
um .
i'm gonna try and look for that wrapping paper .
well that would be good .
well did you see what i .
what is there that you can use because ?
the gold .
is that enough ?
i do not know i have to look .
i didn't actually look at them .
because we actually have a b i g thing that .
i know that's the point .
i just .
i think i used it when i was wrapping right before we left .
so maybe it's behind the couch or something like that .
ooh the old .
the sleepy bear that went to alaska ?
oh the new sleepy bear ?
mhm .
naima it's christmas eve .
what do you think's gonna happen tomorrow ?
do you have any idea what's gonna happen tomorrow ?
in front of the fire place ?
i always did that when i was a little girl .
and when i woke up in the morning .
my stockings would be bulging .
with things .
presents mommy ?
yeah .
presents .
i think a stocking would be a good thing for naima to hang in front of the fireplace .
why the fireplace though ?
who comes down chimneys ?
okay .
i'm coming out and going to work .
that little nap did me a world a good .
really ?
that's great .
i am !
although .
i could wrap some presents .
hm .
well .
i will look for that other wrapping paper .
tomorrow some people are coming to visit us .
do you remember who i said was coming to visit ?
are you gonna make uh .
would you like to do that now ?
later ?
so you think there might be some in the garage ?
the old old stuff ?
um there was .
at a certain point .
for sure .
i though you had trashed it .
at that point i .
i do not know .
i .
it's just .
it's possible .
oh that's it .
that's who's coming .
great grandma .
and daddy and mommy and naima that's who will be here tomorrow .
we'll make special holiday food .
we'll open presents .
maybe we'll play games .
yeah .
i'm sure she'd love to play games with you tomorrow .
even great grandma could play .
please be careful spinning around there .
that doesn't look very safe to me .
if you fall off you it could really hurt .
you could hurt yourself .
are you wearing big kid pants .
did you say ?
okay .
so you gonna notice when you need to pee or poop ?
you do ?
let's go then .
can you go by yourself ?
uh like big kid ?
okay .
well you can finish chewing on your way there .
to the potty .
you gonna take off your own big kid pants and everything ?
i won't come with you you're a big kid .
just call me if you need me to help you wipe .
okay .
oh .
pretty good .
alright .
bedtime is over ?
please don't rip that out .
please leave that .
naima .
please .
leave .
that .
okay so don't destroy the things here okay ?
thank you naima .
let's see .
we have a lot of things to wrap .
we need a wrapping strategy .
alright .
hm .
okay now that daddy's downstairs i'm gonna go get a present for him .
that i have in the other room okay ?
there's sleepy bear .
okay .
this is a present for daddy i don't want him to know about it .
so we have to keep it secret .
secret secret secret .
now what did i do with the scissors ?
there's scissors .
here's tape .
okay .
okay .
you're going to the present wrapping place .
excellent does he like to help wrap presents too .
can you sit down ?
i .
i'm gonna wrap it right here so put your bottom right here .
sit right here .
and i'll let you help me .
that bear still has bandaids on doesn't he ?
yeah .
okay .
this is daddy's present .
just because .
i don't want daddy to know .
what it is ?
let's wrap it in some paper before he comes upstairs again .
because i want it to be a secret .
because it's more fun .
here .
you are ?
okay .
you really need a shirt on so you can wear this mic .
because i'm just putting the mic on the floor and that's probably not such a good place for it .
i know i'll put it right on my pants .
closer to you .
okay !
i'm gonna wrap this for daddy .
i'll let you help put the tape on okay ?
oh okay .
okay .
can you fold this edge up ?
fold that edge up .
no not triangles yet .
this way first .
okay ?
you've done this .
fold this one down .
well first we need some tape .
presents are more fun if they're kept secret .
well i think so anyway .
well .
people have opinions and that's my opinion .
do you need a tissue ?
there's a box of tissues right there if you need one .
oh it was just an itch .
i see .
okay .
do triangles .
take the corner this is the corner .
and then bring the corner up right here .
just bring it all the way up .
like right to there .
and then fold it down to make the triangle .
now take this corner .
fold it .
right there .
and then we made a big triangle here .
and now we can tape it .
here .
good .
yep .
okay .
you just need one .
not too much tape .
and then rub it after you put it on .
okay that's good .
this is a present from mommy to daddy .
i need tags though .
hm .
well i think i might reuse this tag from last year .
whose name is that ?
do you know ?
can you read that ?
read the letters .
yep .
i .
can you sound it out ?
what does v sound like ?
this was .
i don't know when i made this label it was a long time ago .
this is a card .
yes .
you know what other letters begin with j .
that's our letter for the day .
what other letters ?
begin with ?
jammed is a good one .
yep .
yep that can be jammed .
that's sometimes what jammed means .
how about juicy ?
and juice .
those begin with letter j .
jim ?
oh gym .
that actually begins with g .
remember g sometimes sounds like j ?
it's very confusing i know .
i think it is .
um .
joke .
jew .
yes .
junior .
yes .
junior does .
jum ?
jum uh jum isn't really a word actually .
i'm attaching .
the card onto the present .
with the ribbon and the tape like this .
whoa ?
one day a child walked and walked and walked and walked .
mm .
oh that's your staff ?
your red staff ?
what time is it ?
uh .
oh okay .
i won't use your red staff .
don't unwrap the wrapping paper ?
are you going to have a bath tonight or a shower tomorrow morning ?
alright .
to take a shower ?
alright i guess that's alright .
in that case why don't we put a .
some .
a top .
a pajama top on you now .
because it's almost bedtime .
if i bring one out can you put it on by yourself do you think ?
alright .
well you can have a pajama bottom also .
oh please don't rip that paper sweetie pie .
please leave that alone .
do you wanna put on these ?
pajamas by yourself .
let's leave that alone now that you've unwrapped it .
because .
mommy and daddy need .
are gonna need to use it .
there's your pajama .
top and bottom .
can you put them on yourself ?
me ?
why would i do .
why would i wear just bottoms to bed ?
is that what he .
is that what he does ?
really ?
is it not working right ?
do you need help ?
can i see ?
can i just look ?
you know what since you have big kid pants on .
just put the tops on for now .
don't worry about the bottoms because you're gonna have to get an .
diaper on anyway before you go to sleep .
unless your legs are really cold .
are your legs cold right now ?
that's your pajama top .
it can fit on you though sweetie .
oh you know what ?
this is actually for you .
i forgot that i ordered this .
these are some pants for you .
you wanna try them on ?
i hope so because i bought them for you .
if they don't fit i might send them back .
do you wanna try them on ?
why don't you try them on and see ?
just try them on and see if they fit .
i got these for you because i thought that since you're gonna be using the potty a lot more you'd like pants that are easy to get off and on .
easy to pull down .
especially when .
for when you're in school .
and you can go to the potty by yourself .
yes well the teacher's always there to help you if you need help but .
i thought maybe you'd like pants that are easy to get off and on to go to school with .
excellent job .
excellent .
those look very nice .
yeah a lot of pants fit you .
these are slightly long but that's something that mommy can fix .
in fact maybe i'll fix it soon .
let me just .
let me just .
come here for a sec .
just hold still for a sec i wanna see something .
i wanna see how much i need to hem them .
hem means to .
bring them up .
further .
that's about where i'm gonna hem them i guess .
nice pants .
you can take them off now .
every day .
what about ?
they'll need to be washed won't they ?
mommy's gonna hem them and then .
that's great they do fit .
well hemming is .
is a way of making them shorter .
i think you have the right idea .
you can put that top on now .
good .
i need some stronger .
oh yeah ?
what are you putting on him ?
big kid pants ?
is he a big kid naima ?
i didn't think he was .
alright .
oh he's wearing the knickies huh ?
alright .
i don't think they're gonna stay on him .
because they're too big for him .
naima .
they're just too big they're gonna keep falling off .
yeah .
careful i've got scissors here .
stay away from the scissors .
they're sharp .
well not on purpose you weren't but .
i don't know if you realized .
and her rooster ?
that's up to you honey he's here .
your bear .
can you please put the ?
the shirt on .
the pajama shirt .
i want you to put it on .
the row .
white .
no leave that .
naima .
put it back .
please find your pajama top and put it on .
right now .
i asked you to put that on .
tag goes in the back .
it does .
it's on the inside .
this is the part that's gonna go at the back of your neck .
so when you put it on .
yep .
what you do is you find where the tag is ?
and then you hold it like that .
and then open it up .
and then put it over like that .
yep .
there you go .
yeah .
come .
come closer i'll help you .
there .
who says awooga ?
yes ?
really ?
but you don't have a diaper on .
i know .
well you can put them on .
and we'll just take them off when it's time to go to bed and put the diaper on .
that's that's alright .
no but it will be in a little while .
it is .
seven fifteen .
can you gently carry this and put it under the tree please ?
that's the present for great grandma from you .
oh what did i write ?
for grandma .
that's the wrong thing to write .
for .
great grandma .
from naima .

to make himself feel more grown up !

then he tried to run away from his shadow .
there's his shadow .
he jumped off his shadow .
but when he landed .
they were together again !
he came to the corner where the box was and who should he see but .
willie .
peter scrambled under the box he blew .
and blew ?
and !
suddenly out came a real whistle ?

little miss spider popped pout of her egg ?
swinging down from a thread she hung on by one leg .
watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover .
she dangled there wondering where is my mother ?
did she squeeze down a hole or dive under water .
why won't she come out here and meet her new daughter .
she climbed to the tippy top of a tree ?
gazing out on the world she sobbed where can mom be ?
a beetle named betty buzzed by this high perch .
a child needs a mother may i please help you search ?

i don't know for sure but .
yeah i don't know for but she doesn't know that .
i don't know for sure but i'll offer this clue if i were your mother i'd be looking for you .
they flew through the trees spying down from the sky .
and asked all the butterflies fluttering by .
but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone .
that is a lady bug .
she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig .
have you seen my mom she's like me only big .
the sly spider laughed .
that is a spider .
as he gobbled his snack .
up there is a mother who's yellow and black ?
with a heart full of joy she peered over the straw .
but it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw .
it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried .
your dinner is here darlings so open up wide .
yikes .
oh they think miss spider is their dinner .
before she could .
she was whisked out of sight and brave bittle brave beetle betty was hugging her tight .
oh goodness .
betty saved her .
in her warm cozy home .

in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree .
the kind beetle asked won't you stay here with me .
then miss .
then miss spider smiled and held betty fast .

for finding your mother there's one certain test .
you must look for the creature who loves you the .
best .

do you wanna read chester's way instead ?
okay ?
chester's way ?
chester had his own way of doing things ?
he always cut his sandwiches diagonally .
he always got out of bed on the same side ?
and he never left the house without double knotting his shoes .
chester always had the same thing for breakfast .
toast with jam and peanut butter .
and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket ?
just in case .
you definitely have a mind of your own said chester's mother !
that's one way to put it said chester's father !
chester's best friend wilson was exactly the same way .
that's why they were best friends .
chester wouldn't play baseball unless wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first ?
wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless chester wanted to and they always used hand signals .
if chester was hungry wilson was to .
but they rarely ate between meals .
some days i can't tell those two apart said wilson's mother ?
me either said wilson's father .
chester and wilson wilson and chester .
that's the way it was .
they loved to go on picnics .
once when wilson accidentally swallowed a watermelon seed and cried because he was afraid a watermelon plant would grow inside him .
chester swallowed one to .
don't worry said chester if you grow a watermelon plant i'll grow one to .
chester duplicated his christmas list every year and gave a copy to wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway .
for halloween they would always dress as things that went together .
salt and pepper shakers two mittens on a string .
ham and eggs .
they really are two peas in a pod said chester's mother .
looks like it chester's father .
in spring chester and wilson shared the same umbrella .
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other .
in fall they raked leaves together .
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen to they wouldn't burn .
chester and wilson wilson and chester .
that's the way it was .
and then lily moved into the neighborhood .
lily had her own way of doing things .
let's not hurt your teeth okay honey .
she wore bandaids all over her arms and legs to look brave .
she talked backwards to herself sometimes so no one would know what she was saying ?
and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises ?
lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them ?
and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case ?
she definitely has a mind of her own said chester ?
that's one way to put it said wilson .
when lily asked chester and wilson to play they said they were busy ?
when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home ?
if lily was walking on one side of the street chester and wilson crossed to the other side and hid ?
she's something else said chester .
looks like it said wilson .
one day when chester and wilson were practicing their hand signals .
some older boys rode by .
well those are some older boys who rode by and they circled .
well that's an older boy and he's not very nice ?
that's wilson and chester ?
and that's an older boy ?
and that's an older boy .
chester and wilson didn't know what to do .
right .
chester and wilson didn't know what to do .
just when they were about to give up hope a fierce looking cat with horrible fangs jumped out of the bushes and frightened the older boys away .
are you who i think you are chester asked the cat ?
of course the cat replied .
thank you lily said chester .
thank you cat .
you're welcome chester said lily .
thank you lily said wilson ?
right ?
she was .
you're welcome wilson said lily .
i'm glad you were wearing a disguise said chester .
and i'm glad you had your squirt gun said wilson .
i always do said lily .
just in case .
afterward chester invited lily over for lunch .
you have a muscle mouse cup said lily ?
of course said chester .
i do too .
right there see he's holding his cup ?
oh her her cup must be at her house .
chester and wilson cut their sandwiches diagonally ?
lily asked chester's mother if she had cookie cutters and she made stars and flowers and bells .
mhm .
and a flower right .
is that a flower shape sort of .
right .
right .
mhm .
right ?
that night lily invited chester and wilson to sleep over ?
you have a night light said chester .
of course said lily .
right there .
wow ?
chester and wilson wanted toast with jam and peanut butter for breakfast the next morning .
boring said lily ?
try this instead .
wow this is good said chester .
wow said wilson .
after that when lily asked chester and wilson to play they said yes .
right ?
that's right .
sometimes i can't tell these three apart said lily's mother ?
me either said lily's father .
chester and wilson and lily lily and wilson and chester .
that's the way it was .
right right .
drums .
you're right .
you're right .
chester has a purple balloon .
wilson has a pink balloon and a drum .
lily has a broom .
you're absolutely right ?
for halloween they dressed as the three blind mice ?
for christmas lily gave chester and wilson nifty disguises .
well i think this is chester because he's brown ?
this is lily because she's white .
and this is wilson because he's grey .
right right chester right chester is wearing one of lily's boots .
and wilson is wearing the other one of lily's boots .
you have a drippy lollie .
right a big picture .
in spring chester wilson and lily shared the same umbrella .
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other .
in fall they raked leaves together .
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen so they wouldn't burn ?

once upon a time there was a ?
this isn't a this isn't a tape that makes a story happen .
we don't listen to it .

so once upon a time there was a .
what ?
you don't know what story you wanna tell .
okay .
there was a girl named ?
and she had ?
right .
now those stepsisters and the stepmother were they nice to cinderella ?
do you think they were nice to cinderella ?

you don't remember ?
hey don't you have cinderella ?
where is cinderella ?
she's over there isn't she ?
go get her .
okay ?
so when she would do her chores what would she have to do ?
would she have to clean things .
okay ?
how did that go ?
oh that sounds like something that happened when the fairy godmother came around right ?
and they weren't gonna let her go where ?
they weren't gonna let her go to the ?
the ball .
and who was at the ball waiting to meet meet everybody .
that's right .
so if the stepsisters and the stepmother weren't gonna let cinderella go meet the prince how was she gonna get to the ball .
well who came by .
her ear rings .
she gave her ear rings ?
and she gave her the pretty dress ?
how'd she do it ?
what was the magic words ?
boo .

and she got the pretty dress and what else did she get on her feet .
okay so then what'd she do .
oh and who'd she meet there .
what did they do all night ?
they danced and danced and danced right .
but what did the fairy godmother tell her .
she had to be home by when ?
when did she have to be home ?
remember ?
she had to be home before ?
so the clock started to ring and it was twelve midnight and what did she have to do .
did she have to get home ?
how'd she do it ?

wanna blow ?
okay .
well she l walked down the stairs and she lost her slipper and she went back home but who found the slipper ?

so when the prince found the the shoe the glass slipper the next day what did he go do .
that he didn't know right .
he didn't know her name so he went to find the lady .
now isn't that silly .
isn't it silly that the prince danced with cinderella all night lo long and he didn't ask her her name .
what a silly guy .
now he's got a problem right .
all he's got is a shoe ?
he doesn't know her name .

how many teeth are rotten ?
are there only certain ones that are rotten ?
oh dear ?
let me have a look .
oh yeah i see whatchu mean ?
hm do you think we should just uh ?
fill the cavity ?
cavity is a hole in your tooth that you get when your teeth are really rotten .
okay ?
okay ?
then maybe we better fill it with something ?
oh .
yes that is your name .
doctor dentist .
yeah .
okay .
well dentists use the name doctor in front of their names sometimes .
just like for other kinds of doctors .
cause a dentist is really a tooth doctor .
that's why .
what's the patient's name ?
aha .
oh the tool for looking in the mouth is on the floor ?
can i look in his mouth also .
okay .
okay mister bear .
yeah i'm the assistant .
yes oh yes i see that rotten tooth right there .
okay .
i think we should fill it ?
we should fill the hole in the tooth .
well ?
that will help the tooth get better ?
if it's really rotten we might have to pull it out but i don't think it's that bad .
do you ?
oh we have to pull it out .
mm .
hm okay .
well .
hm we need might need some special other tools for that .
can you go find our special tools for pulling teeth out ?
you know what you might want to use is the .
the .
whadaya call 'em ?
tongs ?
not the toast tongs the metal tongs .
do you know where they are .
i don't know actually .
aw .
see ?
come here for a minute .
you know what .
this is what .
this is !
this is what being .

this is when you need a nap .
this is how you feel you get upset about things .

because it might help you feel good ?
that's why ?
sometimes .

it's not .

why don't we give this to the patient .
it might make his teeth feel better .
i'm lookin' for the tongs ?
oh you know what .
i wonder if they're in the kitchen with all your other .
equipment .
do you think .
they could be there ?
we have to buy yogurt ?
there's no yogurt in our house except for the baby yogurt that's the flavor that you don't like .
so i think it would be good if we went in the car .
to get some yogurt ?
after we take the patient's tooth out .
when he's ready to leave ?
then we can leave too ?
here's the tongs ?
yeah !
yeah the silver part !

here's a little thing to squirt water in their mouth ?
hm .
probably lots of things you can pretend .
oh .
it's the syringe .
i think it would be a good pretend thing that squirts water into the dental patient's mouth .
did you find a syringe .
i think that's enough .
uh we need a coupla other things besides yogurt not a lot though .
but you know what .
if i don't find my wallet .
we won't have any money to buy the yogurt with !

we can make shapes and you could glue .
it's called origami paper .

like that .
write something down .
what're you gonna write down ?
well you know what the problem is that the pastels are really hard to um ?
they smudge a lot .
so i wouldn't use them for cards that we're gonna give our children who are friends .

charlie ?
i think you have three more kids in your class ?
steven ?
and i think there's one more girl and one more boy ?
right ?
right .
okay what's this book called ?
franklin ?
rides a bike .
franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run ?
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing ?
but franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels ?
in the spring all of franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes .
beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first ?
she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off ?
look at me she shouted i can ride my bike all by myself .
franklin watched beaver ride around in circles ?
it wasn't long before beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other ?
soon everyone but franklin could ride without training wheels ?
we're going on a picnic said bear come on ?
franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said i'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone ?
aw that's kinda sad isn't it .
yeah .
a helmet and .
a backpack right .
right ?
that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right ?
just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right .
yeah .
afterwards franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike .
he wanted to ride all by himself .
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push ?
franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered ?
and he fell into the .
oh no ?
i can't do it he said i'm never riding this bike again ?
for the rest of the week franklin felt left out .
he watched as his friends rode off without him .
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes .
what are they on here ?
a bridge .
that's rabbit's bike .
that uh is bear's bike .
you're right .
you know what the purple one must be fox's .
right oh my gosh you're good .
i didn't even realize ?
right ?
you're right and the blue one's bear's because bear is big right ?
right ?
right ?
on saturday franklin's friends zoomed by his house ?
that looks like fun said franklin's mother ?
i can't ride without my training wheels groaned franklin ?
did you give it your best effort asked his mother ?
well said franklin maybe i could try one more time ?
it's tippy he cried ?
his mother held on to the seat try it i won't let you go until you tell me to .
franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind .
he felt very unsteady and very unsure ?
i'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling ?
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating ?
it's too hard for me said franklin it was easy for my friends .
do you think everything comes easily for them she asked ?
franklin had to think about that ?
franklin went to the park he saw beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars .
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below .
no beaver said bear do it like this it's easy ?
easy for you said beaver she tried one more time and fell again ?
maybe tomorrow beaver grumbled ?
did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday ?
then you fell ?
but i caught you right you didn't really fall .
franklin remembered when beaver when badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater ?
it's easy said franklin just do it .
badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water ?
but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other ?
i think she's swimming underwater !
are you gonna swim underwater one day ?
yeah ?
with goggles like phoebe wow that's going to be neat .
franklin thought about the first time fox played baseball .
he couldn't hit the ball at all .
but he tried and tried until one day fox got a home run .
like daddy's team right .
well rabbit's just hoping that fox can hit the ball ?
and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on .
and if fox hits the ball rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it ?
that would be great ?
right rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow ?
just then porcupine came by she moved very slowly .
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows ?
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe .
that's it cried franklin and he hurried home ?
franklin put on .
padding .
he lined the walk with old pillows !
i'm ready to try again he told his mother and now i won't worry if i fall .
franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat .
franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up ?
then it happened franklin told his mother to let go ?
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash ?
oh my heavens .
okay ?
can you find him ?
oh the sheep can go in .
that's a good idea .
where are you gonna put the sheep ?
think he'll fit in there ?
what do sheep say ?

can you get that over my heel there ?
oh thank you ?
i'll do the rest of it ?
okay thank you very much doctor lisa ?
i will go home now .
i have an idea .
we could make an animal hospital and pushpa could be the the veterinarian instead of the farmer ?
and she could take care of the farm animals that the farmer brings into the veterinary hospital ?
yes ?
veena has to walk with the animals is there a vehicle that ?
whoop ?
oh okay .
it's not a farmer ?
okay .
oh hm let's see hm let's examine this young calf here ?
is it this boo this ear or this ear .
both boo boos on both ears let me see ?
hm hm hm everything's going to be alright little calf !
hm okay i'm going to give you a prescription and i want you to put this ear cream on the calf .
go get that at the pharmacy is there something wrong with your adult cow as well .
oh you have a microphone injury .
oh this big cow has a microphone injury hm ?
where is it exactly ?
on the tip of the cow's ear alright .
let me just examine this with my special cow otoscope ?
hm yes there's a different prescription that cow needs a different kind of medicine ?
from the pharmacy here you go ?
okay ?
yeah .
thank you for coming ?
i think you should call me tomorrow and let me know if the ears have gotten better after you put the ear cream on ?
okay .
veena put them on both .
that's good .
you know usually it's the farmer who brings the cows to the veterinary hospital .
yeah because cows don't actually ?
well cows cows usually really need a human to to drive them places ?
i guess that's the main reason .
oh they were walking yeah ?
oh it's close by that's why you told me ?
that's good ?
i think they're all in the chicken coop that you made .
oh dear is there a chick emergency ?
oh what's the problem with this young ?
that's good yeah ?
well hello little chick what seems to be the trouble ?
oh you have a foot on the oh injury on the bottom of your foot there .
let me examine this ?
this chick's foot here oh yes okay .
and i suggest that you wrap this chick in a warm blanket ?
for at least a couple of hours ?
well you'll have to find uh something smaller like a cloth napkin .
and wrap the chicken in the cloth piece of cloth .
just for a few hours to help while its while its foot is bandaged and it needs to rest .
it needs to stay warm while it's injured .
and then at one o'clock you can take the band aid the blanket off ?
well you don't need to tape it on all i'm saying is you need to keep the chick chick warm and dry .
and stop it from running around for the next few hours .
well i i would suggest you try to keep it keep it nice and quiet and maybe read it a book or something .
the chick doesn't like long stories i see well maybe you could read it some poetry !
thank you for coming why don't you call me tomorrow and let me know if the chick's foot has gotten better or not ?
oh .
pushpa's over here checking the camera ?
oh good .
i'm glad to hear that .
those these cows need to go back home ?
bring those cows home to get better .
oh dear a fox .
was this fox hit by a car accidentally ?
hm hm ?
think that i will put some nose cream on this fox and just let it go it's a wild animal ?
i'm gonna let it go it should get better by itself ?
the nose cream ?
mm .
well it's a wild animal and i expected that that might happen .
wild animals don't take directions very well .
alright well that's all you're going to get .
even the little bit that was on you for short while should've helped you ?
oh someone ate the chicken and spit it out ?
okay this chick needs to be in a little tiny tiny blanket is there anything we can get how about one of those blue socks on the floor over there .
let's wrap the chick up in that sock ?
here's the chick ?
okay that should keep the chick nice and safe and warm for a while .
yes ?
yes .
who's saying help ?
mm ?
oh dear ?
pushpa is the veterinarian .
oh dear .

are you cold ?
no she can't smell it she's at school .
it's under her tail just like katie and peanuts .
the observatory with no monkeys ?
the observatory never has monkeys in it .
but it's not a sunny day .
besides we just went yesterday .
okay .
alright .
okay which one should we read first ?
paddington .
do you remember what this one's called ?
what's this one called ?
paddington's lucky day .
wow .
one day not long after paddington went to live with the browns at number thirty two windsor gardens mrs brown thought she would take him out shopping .
we're going to the portobello road explained judy .
it's a big outdoor market quite near here .
you should bring your pocket money added jonathan there's a lot to see .
do you remember that i told you that mommy and daddy went to portobello road and bought something ?
do you remember what it was that we bought ?
you know the there's a little picture above your armoire in your room ?
it's a picture of a mommy and her little girl .
and daddy and i bought that at portobello road .
yeah .
before we even had you .
because we knew we were gonna have a little lily .
yeah .
mommy might have to make some tea for herself so she doesn't cough okay ?
we'll finish this first though .
paddington didn't need asking twice and soon afterward they all set off .
suddenly they turned a corner and paddington found himself in what seemed like a different world .
a world of outdoor stands and push carts gold and silver ornaments books old furniture fruit vegetables people .
his eyes grew larger and larger as he tried to take it all in .
one store was even having its picture taken .
that's a new supermarket said judy there must be something special going on there .
paddington's mouth began to water as he peered through the glass .
perhaps i could do some shopping for you mrs brown he asked hopefully .
mrs brown hesitated she wasn't at all sure about letting him go off on his own quite so soon .
but jonathan told her not to worry even paddington can't get lost in a supermarket he said .
what goes in must come out ?
we can meet him by the checkout counter on our way back added judy .
paddington felt most important as he entered the store .
he lifted his hat to the manager who was standing just inside the door and then consulted mrs brown's shopping list .
everywhere he looked there were shelves piled high with boxes and cans .
there was even one shelf with nothing but marmalade .
he could certainly see why it was called a super market .
what do you like to get at the supermarket ?
you like to get drinks at the supermarket ?
that's true we do have to get some drinks don't we we have to get some juice and some milk .
what else do you like to get at the supermarket ?
lemonade .
excellent any food that you like to get at the supermarket ?
um even more drinks wow .
that's a lot of drinks .
his paws were soon full and he was just beginning to wish he had left his suitcase at home when he saw the manager coming toward him pushing a large basket on wheels .
may i suggest you use one of these sir he called .
you can take as much as you want now he continued .
can i really exclaimed paddington .
the manager nodded yes we like to make our customers happy .
paddington looked most impressed .
in that case he said i think i'll have two baskets just to make sure .
the more paddington saw at the supermarket the more he liked .
he felt sure mrs brown would be pleased when she saw all her free groceries .
the other customers looked on in amazement .
perhaps he's trying to win an eating prize suggested one lady .
what's she wearing ?
she is wearing some glasses you're right .
whoop ?
but the customers weren't the only ones who were watching paddinton with interest .
since he had been in the store the manager had been joined by several other important looking men .
and as paddington reached the checkout counter one of them gave a signal and they all started to clap .
what do you see in his basket ?
yeah what do you see anything that you recognize ?
i think i see some .
right there's some chicken over there and some .
right bananas .
and .
celery that's right that's celery .
do you know what this one is here ?
that is actually looks just like lettuce that i think is cauliflower .
right .
yeah .
you don't ?
mommy likes cauliflower .
really okay .
really which cousins don't like cauliflower ?
oh they don't like cauliflower either ?
oh none of the three of you like cauliflower huh ?
well you're right daddy doesn't like cauliflower .
i think auntie likes cauliflower .
and mommy likes cauliflower .
great !
paddington had never been to a store where they tried so hard to make their customers happy .
and he gave the men a friendly wave as he unloaded his baskets .
well done said the lady handing him a ticket .
i hope you've brought a truck with you .
there's over a hundred and fifty dollars worth here .
paddington stared at the long roll of paper in his paw .
hundred and fifty dollars worth he said giving the man who had said he could take as much as he wanted one of his hardest stares .
he opened his suitcase and peered inside .
but i've only got a nickel .
yeah .
what's he going to do ?
oh no !
looking up paddington suddenly caught sight of a crowd of people coming toward him .
watch out cried the lady as he made a grab for his groceries but it was too late .
with a roar like an express train everything began to tumble down off the counter .
paddington was still sitting on the floor covered with groceries when the browns rushed into the store to see what was going on .
all in all he decided he was much safer where he was for the time being .
she has a surprised face i think .
she's going what happened !
that's what she's saying .
where's paddington ?
because he's hiding under all the groceries .
there he is !
great !
you wouldn't think said the manager that giving someone a prize would be so difficult .
a prize echoed the browns .
the manager pointed to a large notice on the wall .
this young bear he said happens to be our one thousandth thousandth customer today .
perhaps you'd like to tell him he's won a free supply supply of groceries ?
all of which said judy as they staggered home laden with groceries only goes to show that bears always fall on their feet .
even in supermarkets agreed jonathan .
paddington sniffed the air happily .
i like the portobello road he said i think i shall always do my shopping here from now on .
yay .

you know what you ate a lot of when we were in ireland ?
a lot of chocolate .
yes we could not find very much to eat there .
and when we took our big long airplane ride .
this is what they gave you for lunch ready ?
they gave you fish and chips .
which you didn't wanna eat because it was just kind of this weird fried fish .
and you didn't like it .
and then they gave you chocolate pudding with chocolate sprinkles .
yeah you liked that .
and then they gave you little chocolate m and ms .
you liked that .
and then they gave you a chocolate bar too .
you liked that too .
so you ate all your chocolate and you were bouncing off the walls because you were so full of chocolate energy .
it's true .
but and you probably don't remember this but there were lots of kids on our airplane .
because they were on a school trip .
and they thought you were very cute and they would bring you toys .
they would come and talk to you and bring you little stuffed animals to keep you happy .

franklin rides a bike .
franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run .
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swings .
did you climb the monkey bars at school ?
yeah .
yes that's right you were taking turns .
but franklin had a problem .
he couldn't ride his bicycle without training wheels .
in the spring all of franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes .
beaver was the brave one and she took her wheels off first .
she practiced and practiced .
she took the training wheels off see she has no little wheels on the back .
look at me she shouted i can ride my bike all by myself .
franklin watched beaver ride around in circles .
it wasn't long before beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handlebar with the other .
franklin's training wheels are right here .
oh yeah he's not his bike must be off .
out of the picture .
soon everyone but franklin could ride without training wheels .
maybe i think you're right .
right .
afterwards franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike .
he wanted to ride all by himself .
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push .
franklin wibbled and wobbled and teetered and tottered then he fell into the flower bed .
i can't do it he said i'm never riding this bike again .
whoa ?
for the rest of the week franklin felt left out .
he watched as his friends rode off without him .
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes .
there's badger too you're right .
on saturday franklin's friends zoomed by his house .
that looks like fun said franklin's mother .
i can't ride without my training wheels said franklin .
did you give it your best effort asked his mother .
well said franklin maybe i could try one more time .
franklin sat on his bike it's tippy he cried .
his mother held on to the seat .
try it i won't let you go until you tell me to .
franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bike from behind .
he felt unsteady and very unsure .
i'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling .
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother .
but you can't give up just because it's frustrating .
it's too hard for me said franklin it was easy for my friends .
do you think everything comes easily for him she asked ?
franklin had to think about that .
franklin went to the park .
he saw beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars .
each time she got to the third rung she fell to the sand below .
whoa ?
whoa ?

it's my first day of school he told goldie the fish ?
franklin packed his new pencil case with a ruler a pencil an eraser and twelve colored pencils that he had sharpened himself .
then he woke his parents ?
look that's franklin's pink eraser .
he has an eraser like yours but yours has a little bee on it .
right .

hurry he said to his parents i can't be late for school .
franklin's mother looked at the clock ?
even the teacher's not awake she laughed it's too early .
you must be very excited said franklin's father .
franklin nodded .
it was so early that there was time to make a big breakfast .
you'll need a full tummy to work at school said franklin's father .
franklin wasn't hungry .
i already have a full tummy he said it feels like it's full of jumping frogs .
franklin's mother gave him a hug .
i felt that way on my first day of too my first day of school too but the funny feeling went away .
franklin ate a little bit and double checked his book bag .
finally it was time to go to school .
halfway to the bus stop franklin clutched his tummy .
i don't wanna go he said .
franklin's father gave him a hug .
that's how i felt when i started school he said but look all your friends are waiting for the bus too .
that's a good question ?
is that beaver's mommy ?
no it's not ?
ah i do not know it looks a little more like an otter to me than a beaver doesn't it .
yeah let's see .
there were there was a big crowd at the bus stop .
there were brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers .
beaver was carrying her favorite book ?
i can read it she said .
ah it's franklin's friend snail .
all of it asked bear .
yes beaver answered proudly ?
franklin rubbed his tummy ?
rabbit pulled out a brand new notebook .
my big sister showed me how to write my numbers he said ?
all of them asked fox .
most of them boasted rabbit ?
franklin looked at his mother ?
i wanna go home he said .
we'll be here after school to hear all about the things you did today she said .
when the bus arrived rabbit grabbed his sister's hand and climbed aboard ?
bear stood on the steps and waved goodbye again and again .
franklin hugged his mother and then his father ?
he kept hugging even after his friends had found seats ?
as the bus pulled away franklin looked out the window .
he didn't know if he was ready for school .
do you think the teacher will yell wondered rabbit who jumped at loud noises ?
do you think there's a bathroom asked beaver fidgeting in her seat ?
i hope someone has an extra snack said bear who had already eaten his .
franklin didn't say anything .
the bus ride seemed very very long .
oh gosh i wonder .
i wonder who that could be ?
maybe .
oh could be the otter you're right .
right .
yeah .
or it could be the raccoon too right .
there's the raccoon ?
yeah ?
i do not know maybe he was sitting in a different seat .
oh yes .
when they arrived their teacher was waiting ?
mr owl said hello in a gentle voice .
he showed them where to hang their coats and where to sit .
he showed them .
it looks like they're playing with playdoh .
yeah .
he showed them where to find the bathroom and offered everyone a piece of fruit ?
then beaver and bear went to the reading and writing center .
rabbit went to the play kitchen .
but franklin stayed in his seat .
well we'll have to ask him ?
what would you like to do today franklin asked mr owl ?
i don't know said franklin rubbing his tummy .
well he's a lil nervous on his first day of school ?
i can't write all the numbers like rabbit can and i can't read like beaver can ?
rabbit and beaver will learn new things at school and so will you .
franklin started to doodle .
franklin stood up ?
franklin sat up taller ?
i know all my colors too he said ?
what color is this asked mr owl holding up a colored pencil ?
it's a special blue said franklin ?
it's turquoise .
now you've taught me something said mr owl .
is there something special you would like to learn .
there were so many things that franklin wanted to learn that he had trouble deciding .
finally he asked mr owl to help him read his favorite book .
he made a building of blocks .
he sorted the money in the classroom store and he painted four pictures ?
one for the teacher one for himself and two for his parents .
it was a wonderful day .
franklin sat at the back of the bus all the way home .
he bumped up and down ooh don't hurt your boo boo sweetie ?
do you want another band aid ?
he was so busy .
what do you want ?
okay can i finish the book and then i'll go get blankie .
he was so busy having fun he almost forgot to get off at his stop .
his parents were waiting .
how's your tummy they asked ?
franklin looked puzzled it had been such a good day he'd forgot all about his jumpy tummy ?
my tummy's empty he said ?
well that's a feeling that will go away too said his father .
i made this for you said franklin's mother and gave him his favorite snack fly pie .

franklin and the thunderstorm .
honey let's not put silly putty in our hair .
okay but we don't want it in our hair because we don't want it to get stuck ?
well then we'd have to cut it out or something ?
i know that would that's true but i still don't know if we'd be able to get it out .
franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes ?
oh great ?
you know what .
i love you ?
franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes ?
he could name the months of the year and all the seasons .
he could read the thermometer and he checked the barometer every day ?
franklin worried about the weather because he was afraid of storms .
one day franklin was supposed to play at fox's house but the sky was getting dark and the clouds were thick ?
maybe i shouldn't go franklin said to his mother .
she looked out the window it probably won't rain until later she said you've got time to get to fox's ?
franklin put on his boots and took the umbrella ?
as franklin hurried to fox's house he kept looking at the sky the clouds moved quickly and the winds swirled dirt in the air ?
franklin felt all jumpy inside ?
fox was playing outside when franklin arrived franklin pointed nervously to the sky i think we should go inside don't you he asked ?
not yet fox grinned i love watching the clouds move and feel the wind blow it's exciting ?
i think it's scary said franklin .
is franklin a lil scared ?
yeah ?
beaver snail and hawk came over to play too ?
my fur feels funny when it's about to storm said fox ?
my feathers get all ruffled said hawk beaver sniffed i can smell a storm coming ?
hm who do you think lives in here ?
oh snail lives in that little tree stump huh ?
i think he does .
that's a cute little house for snail donchou think ?
mhm .
the wind became stronger and hawk flew loop de loops wee he cried ?
franklin held on to his hat and shivered it was almost as dark as night when big father raindrops began to fall .
we should go in shouted franklin ?
no said fox follow me and they raced to the tree house where it was dry .
do you think that's a good idea to go to the tree house when it's a thunder storm ?
no ?
you could get hurt in a tree house that's true ?
fox called his mother it's time to come in it's alright said fox we're in the tree ?
fox's mother was there in a second it's dangerous to be near a tree during a storm she said .
lighting strikes tall things first and you might get hurt ?
right ?
you sure were right ?
franklin held on to fox's mother all the way from the tree to the house they were barely in the door when there was a flash of zig zag light ?
lightening shrieked franklin he trembled ?
thunder he screamed ?
that's okay franklin said his friends we're safe here .
but franklin has crawled deep inside his shell fox's mother brought treats but still franklin wouldn't come out .
franklin's friends begged him to play but franklin stayed put .
then with a flash and a crash the lights went out .
don't worry said fox's mother she lit candles and turned on a flashlight ?
won't you come out now she asked franklin .
no thank you said franklin .
don't be afraid said hawk all that noise is just cloud giants playing drums in the sky .
franklin peeked out really he asked ?
no it's not giggled snail that noise is when the giants go bowling ?
franklin came out of his shell what about lightening he asked ?
oh that's easy said hawk the cloud giants are turning their lights on and off ?
fox smiled i think it's the giants swinging from their chandeliers ?
franklin laughed ?
giants that's ridiculous said beaver mister owl said that lightening is a big spark of electricity that travels from the sky to the ground !
the spark is so hot it makes the air around it pop and that's the sound of thunder .
amazing said franklin .
franklin felt a little better he even played flashlight tag with his friends .
soon there was hardly any lightening the thunder was a low rumble from far away and the rain stopped .
then the lights when on the storms over said fox let's go outside and play .
look said franklin a rainbow .
i know why the storm is over franklin said those giants heard there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow and they've gone to find it .
even beaver had to smile .

rachi and i went and tried to park our car .
it was pretty hard to find a parking space near there ?
jammed up like anything ?
oi !
harold would you help her a little bit .
um .
what's a matter ?
there was long long lines of people .
when you finally got in you saw five no five on each side ten like booths ?
little gay like little teeny houses ?
very teeny .
just big enough for one person .
they was what .
and they was too little .
they was too little ?
did they let you take her in ?
yeah they was just big enough for one person ?
rachi and i went in .
and you push a a lever like a little button on the side ?
something you push down .
i think to the right .
and the curtains close behind you so only you are inside .
and nobody can see what you're voting .
remember .
and then you push down the little levers ?
like one says carter and one says ?
ford ?
and who are the candidates for congress ?
senate ?
congress .
neelea .
and the other guy i forgot .
but who's the candidate for this district .
nealea .
one who's running for reelection .
give me .
congressman .
the u s congress ?
oh i don't remember .

at the .
okay .
at the very end then you press ?
after you vote for all the people you want to vote like one person for president one person for senator .
you vote for different things ?
you then when you're all done you press that lever to the left .
but if you press two people for president it won't work ?
would you want to press the whole thing to finish voting it won't work .
it won't click ?
it'll be stuck .
i think .
well .
is that right .
unh ?
i love these mushrooms .
so another words um voting machines can't be void .
only paper ballot can be void .
mommy look um look .
and that's what happened .
got some .
what ?
look .
yeah here's donald duck .
then the the machine wouldn't work .
when you tried to press it off on at the very end of all your voting you have to press one pin to make the machine click ?
and that way your turn is finished .
but if you voted for both of them .
what is that called ima ?
the voting machine ?
the polling place ?
no what that i go in your box .
oh this ?
uh meat and rice ?
you want some more ?
yeh .
i want some too ?
okay me too ?
so if you didn't click .
if you voted for more than one then at the very end when you go to press it down it won't click ?
and it won't click until you change it until you change it to vote for only one of them .
johnny did jack teach you .

so she asked me if i know of any place where they print in hebrew .
in hebrew .
i thought what a fantastic business in new york that would be very goo .
yeah .
here it wouldn't be good .
i told her to ask the hebrew bulletin ?
they'll probably throw her out of the store ?
i don't doubt it .
what did you say ?
let's eat .
who would you vote for ?
i'd vote on carter .
when we went to vote remember ?
do you know what carter was before ?
he was a farmer .
this is terrible .
i mean .
and know what he grew on his farm ?
guess .
oi .
please .
you know what he grew on his farm .
peanuts .
really .
that humor .
so what huh .
i re i remember when i was in second grade ?
they say he wasn't a good peanut farmer altogether ?
yeah .
that's right ?
he left .
no .
he was never a peanut farmer .
he's a broker .
a peanut broker .
he doesn't grow peanuts .
he buys them from the surrounding farms .
oh .
and he sells them .
i don't know which is i don't know what's true .
who cares ?
a funny guy .
he was a captain in a submarine .
and he was also a governor ?
that's true .
he was in charge of the whole state but not the state of massachusetts ?
the state of georgia ?
cause every state needs somebody in charge of it .
supposedly .
john why don't you why don't you eat your meat .
you like that .
i remember when in the second grade they had a mock election .
they had a mock election today .
am i right ?
oops .
very interesting though .
you had to push the little things and then you push you push the big thing .
and then the curtains opened .
and you were finished .
and then you went out of the building .
and then the next person got a chance .
um it's very very good .
i go uh for ford .
salinger ?
tome salinger ?
well i don't even know .
oh yeah right .
we said we were going to hear your story .

i didn't no i didn't .
i voted for .
register of deeds .
i did not vote for mrs hicks .
oh you know i may have voted for her ?
she was the democrat and i figured should i vote for the democrat .
and i i made i was propagandized by smith's ads .
no .
what i did was i i stopped for each of the resolutions ?
i read each of the !
i did too !
and voted .
and then ?
some of then had no opposition .
i know .
not the resolutions the candidates .
yeah candidates .
these was all democrats .
i don't think there was a single republican who had no opposition .
that's right .
whoever you don't vote for ?
well even if we voted for somebody else ?
isn't the president ?
yeah .
the only thing is that .
let's say we voted for one person but all the other people voted for another person .
the other person would win .
no .
i see how it works .
i took my time on the resolutions the referendum questions ?
all finished .
okay .
you have to urinate .

i made individual choices on the first four spots .
and on the rest i just went right down the line .
i didn't even .

jimmy carter would win .
i just wanted to make sure last time .

modesty takes over .
yeah .
hm ?
i don't know what you're saying .
first you make a line .
a straight line .
you know .
now you're just being funny .
hm .
it looks more like an h .
she made a t this morning .
she was all excited .
she didn't expect it to come out i guess and look like a t .
if it's so easy how come you make all the mistakes ?
hm ?
that's hard work .
mhm .
what is it ?
it's a dress ?
a dress for what ?
for a person ?
why do not you you make an apple ?
i don't know .
it's an upside down apple .
the stem's at the bottom .
what do you think ?
i don't know .
it looks like a six or a nine or something .
what do you think it is ?
i don't know .
well it didn't look like a w to me .
this is a w .
that's a w .
you copy it .
yeah it looks like a w .
what is it ?
oh .
c .
mhm .
you can have plenty of light .

can you spell it ?
what's that letter ?
you know what that is ?
s .
that's right .
and what's that ?
and this one ?
very good .
that one ?
that's hard .
do you know what starts with a k ?
what what name ?
what name ?
no this is an f .
two lines and an e has three lines .
see an e has one at the bottom .
an f doesn't .
oh .
you'll be telling the teacher how to write .
long as she couldn't tell why this isn't a z .
let's see .
aha .
what comes next ?
i think that's an accident .
two out of three .
i don't know sarah .
you never hit two out of three .
and what's the last letter ?
that's the middle letter .
c a what for cat ?
it's the letter you just learned how to make the next letter .

you're the teacher .
you're the teacher .
no ?
what did you do ?
no you show me .
a door a peanut door ?
a peanut what ?
a peanut lollipop ?
who's eating it ?

two legs .
and what's this one ?
that's an m .
m .
yeah like m and ms you know .
you m and ms ?

not very much .
find the a and put the a in between and that'll spell a word .
there you go .
you know what that is ?
man .
no the other way .
yes .
that doesn't spell any word .
now put that first .
put the j first .
and then put the a .
the other side sarah .
put it after it on the other side of the j .
this way .
now put the m after the a .
it has to go the other way around .
right .
m .
you know what that spells ?
no .
i knew that was a natural when she said c a .
it spells jam .
jam .
nothing .
the wall ?
still nothing .
no you make up your own language i'm afraid .
you're gonna never make a word out of that .
there's no word at all that starts like that .
you mixed something up in there .
that's a number not a letter .
can you tell which one's a number ?
which one ?
no that one .
you and your letters .
i don't know .
yes it does but it's not a word .
that's what it spells but it doesn't mean anything .
you can't put it like that .
turn it around .
no turn the e around .
that's right .
turn it around .
that's going the wrong way .
that sounds like when uh .
i think it was courtney one day had a list .

yeah that was a really kind of weird thing that happened with that right ?
was the water really deep .
did your hair get wet .
no it wasn't super deep .
so yeah we went to the river that was a super fun time ?
because of all the river water on you right ?
yeah that was a smart idea to take a shower ?
that used to be the bottom of the ocean you're right .
but now what is it ?
definitely because the whole thing was ocean right pretty much everywhere was ocean .
that's why remember we found those rocks that had little shells fossil shells on it because that used to be the ocean .
i'm trying to think about something interesting else that we've been doing ?
we went to a birthday party the other day .
well what did you guys do at the party .
you're so excited to say what .
i'll give you a hint ?
the clue is three or four pieces .
that was kinda funny about the party three or four pieces of what ?

that was so tasty that what ?
it was tasty that you .
almost could scream .
well he kept taking little pieces of cake right and then i kept giving you some more and more and more .

is it a doll or is it a real person .
oh my goodness .
a real person is for sale .
oh then i can't buy it .
but you can't buy people .
you really can't .
you know what they call it when you buy a person .
they're called slaves .
do you remember when you were in the firefly room and they talked about those people that had to be the slaves ?
and then they went along the undergroung railroad .
so we don't want to sell people anymore .

you think she's saying that she wants some food .
okay well do you sell food there .

okay well i'll have the ketchup then .

okay little baby doll come on and eat your jello .
oh my goodness .
ring ring ring excuse me .
i don't think the jello idea was very good .
she poured the jello all over her head .
let's see what this is supposed to be chocolate nuts .
okay maybe she'd like those .
oh i just wanted to thank you the chocolate nuts are great she ate them and she's probably fine now .
i won't bother you anymore goodbye .
okay pretend that we just walked by we didn't call you up but we came and walked by .
ring ring ring excuse me .
we were wondering if you know where she could get her hair cut it's kinda long .
a horse could chew it off alright well maybe i'll just sit her up right here is that gonna work ?
oh no ?
i thought we were just gonna make it a little shorter now she's bald .
you ate all of her hair ?
oh my goodness .
the horse would have to have time out because he ate all of her hair off ?
alright well look it grew back she's fine ?
i was thinking about what else we've been doing we went on a trip to chicago ?
tell her about what you saw in chicago ?
the tallest building where .
is it the tallest building in the town or the tallest building in the city or the tallest building in the what .
the tallest building in the world it's called the sears tower do you remember what was very interesting when we left chicago about the sears tower .
why didn't we see the top ?
so we were only able to see the bottom how did daddy even know where the building was ?
remember it was a little different from the other ones because it was a dark dark building ?
and he knew where it was located so that's how he kind of knew he said that's it that's the sears tower right there .
cool oh she doesn't know this story either .
this is a story that i was a little bit a little bit i don't know if i'd say angry about but i was a little bit hm remember when we were going to chicago and i told the lady not to give you the toy ?
okay tell her the whole story what happened .
well you didn't really beg for one but you said you wanted one but she asked you she said do you want one and what did you say ?
and what did she do even though i said no toy what did she do ?
she gave you one anyway right ?
but it was a cool toy remember what kind of toy it was ?
mhm it was cool push the button on the snakes head right and then the little big rock would come up and it would make the car go flying ?
you might be able to make that car go all the way up to the ceiling ?
what did you do i dropped my shoe that's what that noise was what did you do ?
did you drop your shoe too .
that's what mine did mine fell off too .
what did you do at brandon and aaron's house with the cars do you remember it was kinda cool ?
made then super tall .
yup you made it super tall you connected all the little car sets together ?
oh my goodness ?
hey you know what leslie also doesn't know what's been going on with our car oh my goodness ?
what's been going on with our car ?
what ?
you're too scared to say ?
well first we had problems with our started and then they fixed it but then they didn't fix it entirely right and we had to send it back and you were so happy right !
yeah and then we had the rental car which you liked a lot ?
remember you were even kinda fussy and you were like you wanted to keep that rental car forever and i'm like we can't we have to pay for it everyday .
so now what's wrong with the car .
you said what do you know about this .
so what's wrong with the car now even though we got it fixed .
the window's broken what's broken about it ?
yeah it's stuck open we're hoping it doesn't rain ?
yeah we've had lots of problems with that car .
we were actually supposed to come here last week and meet her and that was the day the car we got it stuck at your school remember ?
oh my goodness we got stuck at his school and it would not start that was bad ?
i'm trying to think what else we've been doing matty .
so let's see we went to chicago and you started school and ?
do you wanna play with the dollhouse or the dinosaurs or look what she brought ?
do you wanna see what she brought ?
what do you think of that does he look super duper strong ?
hey that guy looked kinda scary ?
they are sparkly ones aren't they ?
do you wanna color any of it ?
he seems pretty strong i have to say what do you think .
what do you think about this face ?
do you wanna pick a page to color ?
oh my goodness .
he is all scratched up ?
what did you have to do at school with like the big a and little a do you remember that one picture ?
do you remember ?
are you saying no ?
okay ?
all the crayons out to do this okay ?
oh no that one's broke how sad ?
you need to be all the same facing the same way and the same height okay .
mhm !
oh what do you think about that is that all going to fit ?
oh my goodness ?
okay which you can have upside down i see ?
cool that reminds me of something that you made at your school do you remember .
the first day of school you came home and you told me about how you made a rainbow right that kinda looks like a rainbow with the different colors ?
yes ?
whoa ?
he totally does he's multicolored you would say ?
he's pretty cool do you remember what color the hulk really is ?
yeah green is that still your favorite color or do you have a new favorite color .
okay your very favorite's this one and this is like your second favorite number two ?
okay which one do you like next after that ?
your very favorite is the one that goes down okay ?
that one the light pink ?
hm cool i like all those colors too ?
let us see if i had to pick my favorite it probably would be ?
mhm ?
i get this group okay .
is this where i get to pick from for my favorite ?
mm okay because i think my favorite out of this group is probably this because look almost the same as my sweater today .
okay so i gotta do it the same way ?
mhm ?
we each have three is that how many you have .
oh one two three four one two three four how many do you have in your hand ?
and i have three so the reason we don't have the exact same number is because we have mister broken one here .
so nobody gets him right ?
okay which color are we gonna do which page you wanna do ?
this is me should i color the rose .
three different colors and see how that comes out ?
this is interesting you know why .
you don't really see the blue you know this light blue i didn't realize it but you don't see that color as well .
how did yours come out ?
oh mostly orange isn't that interesting you actually had all four colors but how come you only mostly see the orange .
okay ?
all of them whoa i got seven of them ?
i do not know you gotta count them ?
ah i think you have eight .
yes you do i only have seven .
okay ready what am i gonna color this rose with all these colors ?
okay ?
orange and then i notice this coming out sort of the purple over there ?
mhm .
oh we had to trade ?
yes and i have kind of this yellow green yellow with rainbow glitter it doesn't look like yellow .
it looks like yellow green doesn't it .
okay i'm gonna draw right here .
mhm .
it's kind of hard to draw with more than one isn't it ?
mostly i see .
green definitely green but your orange and your red comes out pretty good too .
the only one you really can't see very well is the light pink you don't see light pink really .
mm almost it almost looks like this color this darker pinkish color ?
could you see that ?
ah yup ?
i put your name on it ?
you write your name all the time at school now don't you ?
did you ever think about being with the y at the end ?
so you're just matt huh ?
just matt .
what if you had a long name like zachias ?
you know what's going to be a big thing for you to spell ?
zevenbergen .
if you have other matthews you might just be matthew z for awhile .
or matty or matt z ?

okay sell dinosaurs oh and drink milk .
alright so let's see now i think i will buy this one he seems gentle ?
oh is he gonna end up scratching my house and my furniture ?
hm that's no good so which one would you suggest .
aha .
i'll buy the duckbill ?
he seems like he's gonna be okay ?
does he need a swimming pool .
well see i don't know if i want the pool then because i don't want to have to take care of all these animals .
maybe how about this maybe i'll just buy the bed .
it's kind of complicated to have to take all those animals too ?
to the johnson's ?
what will the johnson's do with you ?
put you in what ?
and that will stop you from snivelling ?
what will you do with a lizard's cage ?
but how will that keep you from snivelling ?
that's enough pizza because you don't eat it all up .
alright .
oh .
don't do that joanna .
it's really rude .
if you need to do that eat someplace else .
no .
i just .
continue to talk but maybe we're all talking .
we were having a nice conversation mm .
mm .
and you know what ?
when we tape record it and then laura hears her snivelling on the tape recorder maybe she it will stop her habit ?
do you think that would stop your habit to hear how terrible it sounds ?
you hear it when .
well .
then why do you go on snivelling ?
because she doesn't like the noise .
no .
i'm asking laura .
why do you go on snivelling ?
what ?
noone plays with you ?
i play with you .
that's different than snivelling isn't it ?
laura eat the apple sauce in your bowl please .
you have to eat this .
crying when you get hurt is different from whining isn't it ?
mhm .
it's the whining part of crying that i object to .
i was crying in the middle of the night last night and noone heard me .
were you ?
maybe i didn't .
when were you crying ?
i don't know .
what were you crying about ?
i had a bad dream and i was half awake and half not .
well .
if it's really bad you could always come and tell us you know ?
mm .
i didn't know i was crying .
then i knew it i didn't .
that was .
i know what it was about .
it was about peanuts got killed .
not died by poisoning but got killed .
i see .
and made me sad .

and he sneezed with the food in his mouth right on her .
aha .
did you apple sauce you both liked .
that you didn't spit out .
but practically everything else i made you you'd spit it right out at me .
anything else .
but you like carrots and apple sauce but you didn't like liver .
i went to all the trouble of making this liver for you .
you would take one mouthful of it and then you would take your tongue and spray it all over the place .
you'd go .
then it sprayed everywhere .
oh .
it was awful .
and you like beets .
those were the three things that you liked .
and cereal .

okay let's let's see what's in the front .
check the front .
oh my see you can fix .
oh you can repair tires .
oh you can eddie .
look you can take the tire out and remove it .
look in the front and see what's there .
look at that .
what do you think you'd like to do with it ?
alright we'll do it .
how do you take it off ?
no you have to to repair .
you have to take something off .
see you have to take these off .
do you have a screw driver ?
get a screw driver .
yeah that's a screw driver .
okay now take remove that okay ?
that's it .
turn it the other way .
no ?
alright what would you like to do with it ?
hm ?
wanna put it back inside ?
okay turn it .
aren't you gonna turn it ?
that's it .
screw it together .
okay turn .
good .
oh very good .
don't wanna repair this ?
wanna drive it ?
alright where does that piece go ?
i don't know .
why don't you open the front and see if it belongs in the front .
i guess not .
look in the back .
check the back maybe it's something that goes in the back .
no ?
i think it's an extra then .
why don't you slip it somewhere ?
why don't you put it in somewhere ?
there okay ?
that's a pretty nice car huh ?
what ?
oh that has a book in it for a story .
would you like to hear a story ?
would you like to play store ?
huh ?

oh just like you have in school .
my goodness look at that !
do you remember we saved packages ?
for school ?
would you like to play store ?

go ahead .
isn't it a nice little cash register .
what ?
i would be glad to .
but we have to get a screw driver .
and we have to take off the tire .
okay ?
like that .
yeah you just keep turning that then that will come off .
keep turning keep turning keep turning just move your wrist as you turn .

that's gross i don't really like the snake .
no i really don't well he was cute but i don't like that they have to eat that they're meat eaters and they eat like live things it seems gross .
you and daddy did something else this weekend too that was super fun on saturday do you remember where daddy took you on where ?

five ducks and then you won a whole bunch of little toys like a little harmonica .
yes you did i know you totally did .
so we've been really we've done tons of stuff we went hiking a bunch of times and we hm i'm trying to think about another thing you did that you told me about that was very interesting do you want to tell the story about that girl at your school and the cheese ?
okay .
you can't tell yet okay how about if i count to ten and maybe you tell ?
fourteen okay .
okay let's hear the story .
you don't remember the story you told me the same story yesterday about her at school .
about the cheese .
do you remember the story do you want to talk about something else you don't have to talk about the cheese story if you don't want ?
hm i'm trying to think of what else we've done since you were here .
well there was one time we went hiking and we found something that was very tasty and you ate them all what were those ?
yup we kept finding blackberries and matty kept eating them and mommy and daddy kept picking them right and who kept eating them ?
yeah .
you want to eat that kind you ready for the next stick ?
alright well what about if you don't want to tell the cheese story what about something else that's going on at your school ?
do you wanna explain to her about the sticks we won't say anything about the yellow stick but how does the stick thing work ?
is it like this ?
oh what is it what is the yellow stick ?
and then .
yeah what happens if you do a great job that day what do you get ?
mhm what happens if you get stars through the whole week like the whole week or something what do you get ?
mhm where do the prizes come from ?
mhm and does she choose it for you ?
or someone else who ever gets the prize gets to choose their own ?
doesn't that take a long time ?
now you had your eye on some particular toy what was that that you wanted to get ?
but if you see it when you get to choose from the jar that would be good new right ?
you already got to do that what did you pick ?
remember what you chose ?
there's some what ?
that's okay you can talk about the candy that's fine .
there's a couple of different colors in there right ?
we didn't even start the grape one yet right ?
so what did you do when james came over yesterday ?
you mean when we all went to sullivan's .
oh yeah we all went to sullivan's that's true .
but what did you do when james was at our house ?
i do not know you guys were doing like a marching band for a little while right ?
a music band ?
after we stopped then you did a music band ?
what is that that daddy fixed with the batteries ?
there's lots of stuff at our house that's like that .
oh i remember you're talking about your tape recorder .
daddy put new batteries in it and now it works right ?
i see so you had a music band and you were using that .
and then there was something that happened with the money what was the deal with the money ?
what was james trying to do with the money ?
he was trying to put in there and you were very angry at him .
yeah why did you think he wanted to put it in there ?
and where did you want the money to be ?
out of there .
i remember that was right before we were getting ready to go .
so then we went to sullivan's and that was cool right ?
except you guys kept trying to take that ketchup .
what were you gonna do with that ketchup there ?
yeah i was a little worried .
yes and the ketchup would go everywhere .
that would not have been so good .
