Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the baseline model, it is necessary to know how it is trained.
[Action]: Read the file "train.py" to find information about how the baseline model is trained.
[Observation]: The baseline model is trained using the Trainer class from the transformers library. The training process involves tokenizing the dataset, grouping the tokenized texts into chunks, creating a Trainer object with the specified model, training arguments, and data collator, and then training the model on the training dataset. The model is evaluated on the evaluation dataset after training. The training and evaluation metrics are logged and saved. The model is saved after training and can be pushed to the Hub or a model card can be created. The specific optimizer used for training the model is not specified in the provided information.
