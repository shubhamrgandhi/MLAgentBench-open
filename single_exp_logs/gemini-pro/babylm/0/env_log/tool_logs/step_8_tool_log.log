We are trying to solve this research problem: Improve the baseline model performance on the babyLM Benchmark. 

Summary: This shared task challenges community members to train a language model **from scratch** on the same amount of linguistic data available to a child. Submissions should be implemented in Huggingface's Transformers library and will be evaluated on a shared pipeline. This shared task is co-sponsored by CMCL and CoNLL.

To run the baseline model, execute train.py. It will train a standard gpt2 model on the babyLM data. The final model will be saved to output/ folder.

When you submit your final answer, you will be evaluated on the performance of the checkpoint saved in the output folder. It will be evaluated on a held-out test set.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the baseline model, I need to read the train.py script.
[Action]: Read the train.py script to understand the overall structure of the script, how the model is trained, and how the performance is evaluated.
[Observation]: The train.py script follows a common structure for training machine learning models, including argument parsing, data loading and preprocessing, model and tokenizer loading, training, evaluation, and saving and logging. The model is trained using the Trainer class from the Transformers library and evaluated on the validation set after each training epoch using perplexity as a measure of performance. The script supports training from scratch or fine-tuning a pre-trained model and can be used for fine-tuning CLMs on a specific task or dataset.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to list files in the parent directory to explore the available resources.
[Action]: The agent executed the "List Files" action with the following input:
```
{
    "dir_path": ".."
}
```
[Observation]: The agent encountered an error message:
```
EnvError: cannot access file .. because it is not in the work directory.
```



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous action failed because the directory path was not valid.
[Action]: List Files
[Observation]: The directory path "." is valid and contains the following files and directories:
        babylm_data/
        babyLM_for_hf.py
        backup/
        research_log.log
        train.py*



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: I want to understand the baseline model to improve its performance.
[Action]: Inspect the train.py script.
[Observation]: The train.py script is a Python script for fine-tuning causal language models on a text file or a dataset. It uses the Hugging Face Transformers library. The script can be used to fine-tune a pre-trained model or train a model from scratch. It includes arguments for specifying the model architecture, tokenizer, and training hyperparameters. The script also includes a data collator and a Trainer object for training the model.
