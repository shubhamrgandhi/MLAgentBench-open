Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the baseline model, I need to read the train.py script.
[Action]: Read the train.py script to understand the overall structure of the script, how the model is trained, and how the performance is evaluated.
[Observation]: The train.py script follows a common structure for training machine learning models, including argument parsing, data loading and preprocessing, model and tokenizer loading, training, evaluation, and saving and logging. The model is trained using the Trainer class from the Transformers library and evaluated on the validation set after each training epoch using perplexity as a measure of performance. The script supports training from scratch or fine-tuning a pre-trained model and can be used for fine-tuning CLMs on a specific task or dataset.
