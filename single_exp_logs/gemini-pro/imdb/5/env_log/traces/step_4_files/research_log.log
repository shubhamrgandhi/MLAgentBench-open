Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset, finetune DistilBERT, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent looks for the information in the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent finds information about how to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv, but not about how to finetune DistilBERT.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: To proceed with the research plan, the next step is to load the dataset and inspect it.
[Action]: The action taken was to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation was that the current directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- research_log.log
- train.py
