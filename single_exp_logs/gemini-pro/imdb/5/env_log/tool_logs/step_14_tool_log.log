===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset, finetune DistilBERT, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent looks for the information in the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent finds information about how to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv, but not about how to finetune DistilBERT.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: To proceed with the research plan, the next step is to load the dataset and inspect it.
[Action]: The action taken was to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation was that the current directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- research_log.log
- train.py



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The `datasets` library is a powerful tool for loading and inspecting datasets. It is recommended to use it to load the IMDB dataset.
[Action]: Edited the `train.py` script to load and inspect the IMDB dataset using the `datasets` library.
[Observation]: The edited `train.py` script was saved successfully. The diff shows that the code to load and inspect the IMDB dataset was added to the beginning of the file.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The script "train.py" was executed to load and inspect the IMDB dataset.

[Action]: The script "train.py" was executed.

[Observation]: The script loaded the IMDB dataset and inspected it. The dataset contains three splits: train, test, and unsupervised. Each split contains 25,000, 25,000, and 50,000 examples, respectively. The script also attempted to make a prediction using the model, but an error occurred: "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable".



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable" suggests that the model has not been defined or loaded yet. To resolve this issue, it is necessary to inspect the script to identify where the model is defined or loaded.

[Action]: Inspected the first 10 lines of the script "train.py".

[Observation]: The first 10 lines of the script import necessary libraries and load the IMDB dataset. There is no code related to defining or loading the model.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The first 10 lines of the script import necessary libraries and load the IMDB dataset. There is no code related to defining or loading the model in the first 10 lines of the script. The next step is to define or load the model.
[Action]: Add the following code after the line that prints the dataset:

```python
# Define or load the model
model = torch.hub.load('huggingface/pytorch-transformers', 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english')
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code to define or load the model is added after the line that prints the dataset.


```
Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:
