===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The syntax error is in the first line of the script. The error is caused by the fact that the `pip install` command is not a valid Python statement.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The syntax error is in the first line of the script.
Thought:     I should next edit the script to remove the `pip install` command.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Remove the following code from the beginning of the script:\n\npip install sacremoses importlib_metadata",
    "save_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:
