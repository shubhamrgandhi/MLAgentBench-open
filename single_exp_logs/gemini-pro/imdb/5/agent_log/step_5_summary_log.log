Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The first 10 lines of the script import necessary libraries and load the IMDB dataset. There is no code related to defining or loading the model in the first 10 lines of the script.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The first 10 lines of the script import necessary libraries and load the IMDB dataset.
2. Directly confirmed: There is no code related to defining or loading the model in the first 10 lines of the script.
Thought:     I should next add code to define or load the model.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The first 10 lines of the script import necessary libraries and load the IMDB dataset. There is no code related to defining or loading the model in the first 10 lines of the script. The next step is to define or load the model.
[Action]: Add the following code after the line that prints the dataset:

```python
# Define or load the model
model = torch.hub.load('huggingface/pytorch-transformers', 'distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english')
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code to define or load the model is added after the line that prints the dataset.
