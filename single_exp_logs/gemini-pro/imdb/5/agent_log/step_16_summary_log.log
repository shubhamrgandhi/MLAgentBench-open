===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The script still has an error. The error is a syntax error.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.














Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The script still has an error.
Thought:       I should next remove the `pip install` command from the beginning of the script.
Action:       Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:       {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Remove the following code from the beginning of the script:\n\npip install sacremoses importlib_metadata",

}

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
