Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The action to list files in the current directory was successful. The directory contains the following files: "backup/", "research_log.log", and "train.py".
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: The action to list files in the current directory was successful.
Thought:   I should next install the missing dependencies.
