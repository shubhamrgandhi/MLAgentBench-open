===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script "train.py" still has an error. The error is a syntax error, which means that there is something wrong with the way the code is written.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The script "train.py" still has an error.
Thought:    I should next inspect the script to see what the syntax error is.
Action:    Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 1,
    "end_line_number": 10
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 40):

pip install sacremoses importlib_metadata

import datasets

# Load the IMDB dataset
raw_dataset = datasets.load_dataset("imdb")

# Inspect the dataset
print(raw_dataset)

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script "train.py" has a syntax error. The first 10 lines of the script were inspected to identify the syntax error.
[Action]: Inspected the first 10 lines of the script "train.py".
[Observation]: The first 10 lines of the script "train.py" are:

```
pip install sacremoses importlib_metadata

import datasets

# Load the IMDB dataset
raw_dataset = datasets.load_dataset("imdb")

# Inspect the dataset
print(raw_dataset)
