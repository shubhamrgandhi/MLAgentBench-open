===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The code was executed successfully. However, an error occurred when loading the model: "RuntimeError: Missing dependencies: sacremoses, importlib_metadata". This error indicates that the necessary dependencies are not installed.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed: The code was executed successfully.
2. Directly confirmed: An error occurred when loading the model: "RuntimeError: Missing dependencies: sacremoses, importlib_metadata".
Thought:  I should next install the missing dependencies.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": "C:\\Users\\91932\\miniconda3\\envs\\mlagentbenchopen\\Lib\\site-packages"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: cannot access file C:\Users\91932\miniconda3\envs\mlagentbenchopen\Lib\site-packages because it is not in the work directory.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action was taken to list files in the directory "C:\\Users\\91932\\miniconda3\\envs\\mlagentbenchopen\\Lib\\site-packages" to investigate the missing dependencies error.
