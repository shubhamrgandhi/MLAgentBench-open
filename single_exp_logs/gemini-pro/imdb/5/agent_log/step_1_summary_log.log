===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the problem and the dataset. The dataset is the IMDB dataset, which is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels. The goal is to finetune DistilBERT on the dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: I have understood the problem and the dataset. The dataset is the IMDB dataset, which is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels. The goal is to finetune DistilBERT on the dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
Thought:   I should next load the dataset and inspect it.
Action:   List Files
Action Input:   {
    "dir_path": "."
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
