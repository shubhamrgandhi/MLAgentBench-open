===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script still has an error. The error is that the dependencies `sacremoses` and `importlib_metadata` are missing.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.












Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The script still has an error.
Thought:      I should next install the missing dependencies.
