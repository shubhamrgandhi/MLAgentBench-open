===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script "train.py" was edited successfully. The following code was added to the beginning of the script:

```
pip install sacremoses importlib_metadata
```

This code installs the missing dependencies sacremoses and importlib_metadata.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset. In progress.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The script "train.py" was edited successfully.
Thought:    I should next execute the script to see if the error is resolved.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\imdb\5\imdb\train.py", line 1
    pip install sacremoses importlib_metadata
        ^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script "train.py" was edited successfully, but it still has an error. The error is a syntax error, which means that there is something wrong with the way the code is written.
[Action]: Execute the script "train.py".
[Observation]: The script "train.py" was executed, and it produced a syntax error. The error message is: "invalid syntax".
