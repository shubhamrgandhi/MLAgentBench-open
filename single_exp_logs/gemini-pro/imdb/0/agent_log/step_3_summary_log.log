Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. The dataset is now loaded and its statistics are printed.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it. Done.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:    
1. The problem is to finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. **Confirmed.**
2. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. **Confirmed.**
3. The current directory contains the `train.py` file, a `backup` directory, and a `research_log.log` file. **Confirmed.**
4. The dataset is now loaded and its statistics are printed. **Confirmed.**
Thought:    I should inspect the dataset to get a better understanding of its structure and content.
Action:    Understand File
Action Input:    {
    "file_name": "train.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "The structure and content of the dataset."

        [Observation]:
        ```
        - The dataset used is the IMDb dataset, which is loaded using the `datasets.load_dataset("imdb")` function. (Line 7)


- The dataset statistics are printed using the `print(dataset.info)` function. (Line 8)


- The dataset is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not specified in the code. (Line 15)


- The model is defined, but the specific model architecture and parameters are not specified in the code. (Line 17)


- The model is trained, but the specific training procedure and hyperparameters are not specified in the code. (Line 19)


- The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is printed. The predictions of probabilities per class are also saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Lines 21-30)


- The accuracy on the test set is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels and dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. (Lines 25-27)


- The predictions of probabilities per class are saved to a CSV file with two columns, one for the predicted probability of the positive class and one for the predicted probability of the negative class. The index of each row corresponds to the index of the corresponding data point in the test set. (Lines 28-30)
