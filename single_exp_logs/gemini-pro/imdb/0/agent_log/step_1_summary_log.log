===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the problem and the dataset. I need to load the dataset and inspect it next.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:  
1. The problem is to finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. **Confirmed.**
2. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. **Confirmed.**
Thought:   I should load the dataset and inspect it.
