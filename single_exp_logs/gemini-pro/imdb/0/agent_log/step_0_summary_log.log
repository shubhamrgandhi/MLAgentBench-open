===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to come up with a plan to solve it.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the dataset.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.


Fact Check: 
1. The problem is to finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
2. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library.
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem and the dataset.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "train.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "How to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        - The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 10)


- The data is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not shown in the provided code. (Line 12)


- The model is defined, but the specific model architecture and implementation are not shown in the provided code. (Line 14)


- The model is trained, but the specific training procedure and hyperparameters are not shown in the provided code. (Line 16)


- The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is calculated. The predictions of probabilities per class for the test set examples are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Lines 18-26)


- The `submission.csv` file is created using the `to_csv` function from the `pandas` library. The index of the DataFrame is used as the `idx` column in the CSV file. (Line 27)

In this segment, I cannot find:
- Specific details about the data preprocessing steps.
- Specific details about the model architecture and implementation.
- Specific details about the training procedure and hyperparameters.

[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file train.py.
