    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: The structure and content of the dataset.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The dataset used is the IMDb dataset, which is loaded using the `datasets.load_dataset("imdb")` function. (Line 7)


- The dataset statistics are printed using the `print(dataset.info)` function. (Line 8)


- The dataset is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not specified in the code. (Line 15)


- The model is defined, but the specific model architecture and parameters are not specified in the code. (Line 17)


- The model is trained, but the specific training procedure and hyperparameters are not specified in the code. (Line 19)


- The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is printed. The predictions of probabilities per class are also saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Lines 21-30)


- The accuracy on the test set is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels and dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. (Lines 25-27)


- The predictions of probabilities per class are saved to a CSV file with two columns, one for the predicted probability of the positive class and one for the predicted probability of the negative class. The index of each row corresponds to the index of the corresponding data point in the test set. (Lines 28-30)
