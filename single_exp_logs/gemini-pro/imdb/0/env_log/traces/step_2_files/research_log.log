Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file train.py.
[Observation]: The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. The data is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not shown in the provided code. The model is defined, trained, and evaluated on the test set, but the specific model architecture, implementation, training procedure, and hyperparameters are not shown in the provided code. The predictions of probabilities per class for the test set examples are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv` using the `to_csv` function from the `pandas` library. The index of the DataFrame is used as the `idx` column in the CSV file.
