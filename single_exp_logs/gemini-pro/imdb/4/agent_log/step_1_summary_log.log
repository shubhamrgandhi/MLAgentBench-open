===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   Now I understand the problem and the dataset. I need to load the dataset and inspect it.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
Thought:   I should load the dataset and inspect it. I can use the List Files action to list the files in the current directory and the Inspect Script Lines action to inspect the train.py file.
Action:   List Files
Action Input:   {
    "dir_path": "."
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        backup/
research_log.log
train.py

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
