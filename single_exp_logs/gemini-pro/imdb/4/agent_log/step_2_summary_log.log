===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The current directory contains the backup folder, the research log file, and the train.py file. I need to inspect the train.py file to see how the dataset is loaded.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Finetune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
Thought:    I should inspect the train.py file to see how the dataset is loaded. I can use the Inspect Script Lines action to inspect the train.py file.
Action:    Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 10,
    "end_line_number": 16
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 27):

    #TODO: define model here
    model = None

    #TODO: train model

    #evaluate model and print accuracy on test set, also save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv
    submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(imdb["test"])))
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The goal is to inspect the train.py file to understand how the dataset is loaded. The Inspect Script Lines action can be used to inspect specific lines of the train.py file.
[Action]: The Inspect Script Lines action was used to inspect lines 10 to 16 of the train.py file.
[Observation]: The code in lines 10 to 16 of the train.py file defines a model, trains the model, evaluates the model on the test set, and saves the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv. However, the code does not contain any information about how the dataset is loaded.
