    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: What is the problem? What is the dataset?
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
**Problem:**
- The problem is to evaluate a model on the IMDB dataset and print the accuracy on the test set. The predictions of probabilities per class should also be saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`.

**Dataset:**
- The dataset used is the IMDB dataset, which is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels (positive or negative).

**Critical Lines:**
- Line 10: `imdb = load_dataset("imdb")`: This line loads the IMDB dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library.
- Line 16: `submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(imdb["test"])))`: This line creates a Pandas DataFrame with two columns (for the predicted probabilities of the positive and negative classes) and a number of rows equal to the length of the test set.
- Line 17: `acc = 0`: This line initializes a variable `acc` to store the accuracy of the model on the test set.
- Lines 19-23: This loop iterates over the test set, makes a prediction for each data point, and updates the `submission` DataFrame and the `acc` variable accordingly.
- Line 26: `print("Accuracy: ", acc/len(imdb["test"]))`: This line prints the accuracy of the model on the test set.
- Line 27: `submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index_label='idx')`: This line saves the `submission` DataFrame to a CSV file named `submission.csv`, with the index column labeled as `idx`.
