Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent asks the assistant to understand the file train.py.
[Observation]: The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. The data is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not shown in the provided code. The model is defined, trained, and evaluated on the test set. The predictions of probabilities per class for the test set examples are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. The `submission.csv` file is created using the `to_csv` function from the `pandas` library. The index of the DataFrame is used as the `idx` column in the CSV file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to load the dataset and inspect it.
[Action]: The agent lists the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- research_log.log
- train.py
