    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 8)


- The data is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not shown in the provided code. (Line 10)


- The model is defined, but the specific model architecture and implementation are not shown in the provided code. (Line 12)


- The model is trained, but the specific training procedure and hyperparameters are not shown in the provided code. (Line 14)


- The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is calculated. The predictions of probabilities per class for the test set examples are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Lines 16-25)


- The `submission.csv` file is created using the `to_csv` function from the `pandas` library. The index of the DataFrame is used as the `idx` column in the CSV file. (Line 26)
