The `model` is a DistilBERT model, which expects a tuple of inputs, including the input IDs, attention mask, and token type IDs.

Did you mean: 'next'?`.\n\n\n\nStep 9:\n[Reasoning]: The script execution resulted in an error because the `text` variable was not defined. To fix this, the `text` variable needs to be defined at the beginning of the script.\n[Action]: Added the following line at the beginning of the `train.py` script:\n```\ntext = data[\"text\"]\n```\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the line `text = data[\"text\"]` was added at the beginning of the script.\n\n\n\nStep 10:\n[Reasoning]: The script `train.py` was executed to fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.\n\n[Action]: The script `train.py` was executed.\n\n[Observation]: The script `train.py` failed to execute due to a `NameError: name 'data' is not defined`.\n\n",
