===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The edit is correct and desirable. The `transformers` library is now imported, and the DistilBERT model is properly defined. I can now execute the script again.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:      
1. Confirmed.
2. Confirmed.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:      I should execute the `train.py` script again.
Action:      Execute Script
Action Input:      {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):

                          ^^^^

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script `train.py` was executed to fine-tune the DistilBERT model on the dataset.

[Action]: The `train.py` script was executed.

[Observation]: The script execution resulted in an error: `NameError: name 'text' is not defined. Did you mean: 'next'?`.
