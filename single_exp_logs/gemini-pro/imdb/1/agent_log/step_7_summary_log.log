===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The error is in the line `pred = model(text)`. The `model` is a DistilBERT model, which expects a tuple of inputs, including the input IDs, attention mask, and token type IDs. However, the `text` variable is just a string, which is not a valid input for the model.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:      
1. Confirmed.
2. Confirmed.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:      I should preprocess the data and convert the text to a tuple of inputs that can be used by the DistilBERT model.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error is in the line `pred = model(text)`. The `model` is a DistilBERT model, which expects a tuple of inputs, including the input IDs, attention mask, and token type IDs. However, the `text` variable is just a string, which is not a valid input for the model.

[Action]: Added the following lines before the line `pred = model(text)`:

```
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
input_ids = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
attention_mask = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt").attention_mask
```
