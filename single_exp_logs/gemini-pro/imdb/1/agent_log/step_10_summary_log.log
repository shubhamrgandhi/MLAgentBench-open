Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The edit is correct and desirable. The `text` variable is now defined at the beginning of the script. I can now execute the script again.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.












Fact Check:       
1. Confirmed.
2. Confirmed.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:       I should execute the `train.py` script again.
Action:       Execute Script
Action Input:       {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\imdb\1\imdb\train.py", line 10, in <module>
    text = data["text"]
           ^^^^
NameError: name 'data' is not defined

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script `train.py` was executed to fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.

[Action]: The script `train.py` was executed.

[Observation]: The script `train.py` failed to execute due to a `NameError: name 'data' is not defined`.
