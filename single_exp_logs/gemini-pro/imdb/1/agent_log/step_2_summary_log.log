Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The current directory contains the `train.py` file, a `backup` directory, and a `research_log.log` file. I need to load the dataset and inspect it.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Confirmed.
2. Confirmed.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:   I should load the dataset and inspect it.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\imdb\1\imdb\train.py", line 21, in <module>
    pred = model(text) # TODO: replace with proper prediction
           ^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
