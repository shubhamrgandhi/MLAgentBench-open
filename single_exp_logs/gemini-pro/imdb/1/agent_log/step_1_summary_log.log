===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the problem and the dataset. I need to load the dataset and inspect it.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Confirmed.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.

Thought:   I should load the dataset and inspect it.
Action:   List Files
Action Input:   {
    "dir_path": "."
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        backup/
research_log.log
train.py

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
