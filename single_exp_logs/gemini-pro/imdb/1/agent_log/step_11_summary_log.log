===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:        The script execution resulted in an error: `NameError: name 'data' is not defined`. This error is because the `data` variable is not defined in the script.
Research Plan and Status:        
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.














Fact Check:        
1. Confirmed.
2. Confirmed.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:        I should define the `data` variable in the `train.py` script.
Action:        Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:        {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following line at the beginning of the script:\n\n```\ndata = imdb[\"train\"]\n```",
    "save_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The environment has shut down because the maximum number of steps or time has been reached. Please submit your final answer.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
