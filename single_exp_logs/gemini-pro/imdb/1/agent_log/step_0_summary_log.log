===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to come up with a research plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the dataset.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.


Fact Check:  
1. Guessed.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem and the dataset.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "train.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "How to load the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        - The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 8)


- The data is preprocessed, but the specific preprocessing steps are not shown in the provided code. (Line 10)


- The model is defined, but the specific model architecture and implementation are not shown in the provided code. (Line 12)


- The model is trained, but the specific training procedure and hyperparameters are not shown in the provided code. (Line 14)


- The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is calculated. The predictions of probabilities per class for the test set examples are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Lines 16-25)


- The `submission.csv` file is created using the `to_csv` function from the `pandas` library. The index of the DataFrame is used as the `idx` column in the CSV file. (Line 26)
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
