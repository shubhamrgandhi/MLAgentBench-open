    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How to load the dataset, how to fine-tune DistilBERT, how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- Dataset Loading:
  - The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 7)
  - The specific dataset being loaded is the IMDB dataset, which is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels (positive or negative).


- Model Definition:
  - In this segment, I cannot find any information about how the model is defined.


- Model Training:
  - In this segment, I cannot find any information about how the model is trained.


- Model Evaluation:
  - The model is evaluated on the test set of the IMDB dataset. (Line 19)
  - The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels. (Line 20)
  - The per-class probabilities for each test set example are saved to a Pandas DataFrame called `submission`. (Line 22)


- Saving Predictions:
  - The `submission` DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Line 27)
  - The index of the DataFrame is used as the `idx` column in the CSV file. (Line 27)
