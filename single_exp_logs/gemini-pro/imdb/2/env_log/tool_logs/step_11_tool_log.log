===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand the problem and the provided code. The action is to understand the file "train.py".
[Action]: The file "train.py" is analyzed to find information about how to load the dataset, how to fine-tune DistilBERT, and how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Observation]: The file "train.py" contains information about how to load the dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. However, it does not contain information about how to fine-tune DistilBERT or how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The dataset is not yet loaded, so the next step is to load it and inspect it.
[Action]: The `ls` command is used to list the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files:
- `backup/`
- `research_log.log`
- `train.py`



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The script "train.py" was executed to load the dataset using the "datasets" library.

[Action]: The script "train.py" was executed.

[Observation]: The execution of the script resulted in a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed with a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` error because the `model` variable was not defined. To fix this, I need to define the model before I can use it to make predictions.

[Action]: I added the following code to the beginning of the script:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
```

This code imports the necessary libraries and defines the model and tokenizer.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The previous action added the necessary code to define the model and tokenizer using the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` and `AutoTokenizer` classes from the `transformers` library. The script was then executed again to see if the error was fixed.
[Action]: The script `train.py` was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a `RuntimeError` indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1.
