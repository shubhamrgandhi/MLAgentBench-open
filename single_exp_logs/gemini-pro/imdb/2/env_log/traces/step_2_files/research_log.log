Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand the problem and the provided code. The action is to understand the file "train.py".
[Action]: The file "train.py" is analyzed to find information about how to load the dataset, how to fine-tune DistilBERT, and how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Observation]: The file "train.py" contains information about how to load the dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. However, it does not contain information about how to fine-tune DistilBERT or how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
