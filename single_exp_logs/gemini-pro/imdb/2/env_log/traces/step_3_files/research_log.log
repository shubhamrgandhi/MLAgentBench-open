Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand the problem and the provided code. The action is to understand the file "train.py".
[Action]: The file "train.py" is analyzed to find information about how to load the dataset, how to fine-tune DistilBERT, and how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Observation]: The file "train.py" contains information about how to load the dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. However, it does not contain information about how to fine-tune DistilBERT or how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The dataset is not yet loaded, so the next step is to load it and inspect it.
[Action]: The `ls` command is used to list the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files:
- `backup/`
- `research_log.log`
- `train.py`
