===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The current directory contains the `backup/` directory, the `research_log.log` file, and the `train.py` file. I need to load the dataset using the `datasets` library.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
- The current directory contains the `backup/` directory, the `research_log.log` file, and the `train.py` file. **[Confirmed]**


Thought:    I should load the dataset using the `datasets` library.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

           ^^^^^^^^^^^

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
