===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The script execution failed with a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` error. This error is likely caused by the fact that the `model` variable is not defined anywhere in the script. I need to define the model before I can use it to make predictions.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:     
- The script execution failed with a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` error. **[Confirmed]**


Thought:     I should define the model before I can use it to make predictions.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed with a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` error because the `model` variable was not defined. To fix this, I need to define the model before I can use it to make predictions.

[Action]: I added the following code to the beginning of the script:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
```

This code imports the necessary libraries and defines the model and tokenizer.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.
