Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:        The truncation process in the `train.py` script is simply slicing the input sequence to the maximum sequence length. This is not the correct way to truncate the sequence, as it may result in incomplete words or sentences. I need to use a proper tokenization method to truncate the sequence, such as using the `truncate_sequences` function from the `transformers` library.
Research Plan and Status:        
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.














Fact Check:        
- The truncation process in the `train.py` script is simply slicing the input sequence to the maximum sequence length. **[Confirmed]**
- This is not the correct way to truncate the sequence, as it may result in incomplete words or sentences. **[Confirmed]**


Thought:        I should use a proper tokenization method to truncate the sequence, such as using the `truncate_sequences` function from the `transformers` library.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The truncation process in the `train.py` script is simply slicing the input sequence to the maximum sequence length, which may result in incomplete words or sentences. A proper tokenization method should be used to truncate the sequence.
[Action]: Edited the `train.py` script to replace the truncation process with the `truncate_sequences` function from the `transformers` library.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the truncation process is replaced with the `truncate_sequences` function.
