Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:        The `train.py` script now uses the `truncate_sequences` function from the `transformers` library to truncate the input sequences. This should ensure that the input sequences are truncated correctly and that the model can process them without errors.
Research Plan and Status:        
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.














Fact Check:        
- The `train.py` script now uses the `truncate_sequences` function from the `transformers` library to truncate the input sequences. **[Confirmed]**
- This should ensure that the input sequences are truncated correctly and that the model can process them without errors. **[Guessed]**


Thought:        I should now be able to fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
Action:        Execute Script
Action Input:        {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The `train.py` script was executed to fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The `train.py` script was executed with the following input:
```
{
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
```
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a `TypeError` exception. The error message indicates that the `truncate_sequences()` method of the tokenizer was called with an unexpected keyword argument `max_length`.
