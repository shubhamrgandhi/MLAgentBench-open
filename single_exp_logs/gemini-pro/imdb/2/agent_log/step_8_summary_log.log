===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The `train.py` script contains a loop that truncates the input sequences to the maximum sequence length of 512. However, the error message indicates that the input sequence length is still longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model. This suggests that the truncation process is not working correctly. I need to investigate the truncation process to find out why it is not working as expected.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.












Fact Check:       
- The `train.py` script contains a loop that truncates the input sequences to the maximum sequence length of 512. **[Confirmed]**
- The error message indicates that the input sequence length is still longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model. **[Confirmed]**


Thought:       I should investigate the truncation process to find out why it is not working as expected.
Action:       Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:       {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 15,
    "end_line_number": 24
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 42):

    for idx, data in enumerate(imdb["train"]):
        text = data["text"]
        text = text[:max_length]
        imdb["train"][idx]["text"] = text
    for idx, data in enumerate(imdb["test"]):
        text = data["text"]
        text = text[:max_length]
        imdb["test"][idx]["text"] = text

    #TODO: define model here

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error message indicates that the input sequence length is still longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model. The `train.py` script contains a loop that truncates the input sequences to the maximum sequence length of 512. I need to inspect the script to see if the truncation process is working correctly.
[Action]: Inspected lines 15-24 of the `train.py` script.
[Observation]: The script contains a loop that truncates the input sequences to the maximum sequence length of 512. The loop iterates over the training and test data, truncating the text in each data point to the maximum sequence length.
