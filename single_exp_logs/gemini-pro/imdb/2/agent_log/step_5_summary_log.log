Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script execution failed with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. This error is likely caused by the fact that the input sequence length is longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model. I need to truncate the input sequences to the maximum sequence length.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:      
- The script execution failed with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. **[Confirmed]**


Thought:      I should truncate the input sequences to the maximum sequence length.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. This error is likely caused by the fact that the input sequence length is longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model. I need to truncate the input sequences to the maximum sequence length.
[Action]: I added the following code before the line `inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")` in the `train.py` script:
```python
max_length = 512
text = text[:max_length]
```
This code truncates the input text to the maximum sequence length of 512.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.
