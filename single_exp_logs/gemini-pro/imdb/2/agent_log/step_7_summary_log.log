Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The script execution failed with the same `RuntimeError` as before, indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. This suggests that the input sequence length is still longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model, even after truncation. I need to investigate further to find out why this is happening.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem and the provided code. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.












Fact Check:       
- The script execution failed with the same `RuntimeError` as before, indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. **[Confirmed]**


Thought:       I should investigate further to find out why the input sequence length is still longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model, even after truncation.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed with the same `RuntimeError` as before, indicating that the size of tensor `a` (532) must match the size of tensor `b` (512) at non-singleton dimension 1. This suggests that the input sequence length is still longer than the maximum sequence length allowed by the model, even after truncation. I need to investigate further to find out why this is happening.
[Action]: Inspected lines 11-36 of the script `train.py`.
[Observation]: The code snippet shows that the maximum sequence length is set to 512 and the text is truncated to this length for both the training and test sets. However, the error message indicates that the input sequence length is still longer than 512. This suggests that there might be an issue with the truncation process or that the input sequences are longer than the maximum allowed length.
