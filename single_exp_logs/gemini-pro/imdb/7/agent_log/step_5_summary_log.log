Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     I have defined the model. The next step is to train it.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it. Done.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:     
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
4. This is a guess.
Thought:     I should train the model using the `Trainer` class from the `datasets` library.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model has been defined and the next step is to train it. The `Trainer` class from the `datasets` library can be used to train the model.
[Action]: The following code was added to the `train.py` script:
```python
# Train the model
from datasets import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(model=model, train_dataset=dataset['train'], eval_dataset=dataset['test'], epochs=3, batch_size=32)
trainer.train()
```
[Observation]: The edited file was saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code to train the model using the `Trainer` class was added.
