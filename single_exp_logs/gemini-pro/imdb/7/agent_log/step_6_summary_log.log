===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     I have trained the model. The next step is to evaluate it and save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it. Done.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset. Done.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:     
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
4. This is a guess.
Thought:     I should evaluate the model and save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following code to the script:\n\n```python\n# Evaluate the model and print accuracy on test set, also save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv\nacc = 0\nfor idx, data in enumerate(imdb[\"test\"]):\n    text = data[\"text\"]\n    label = data[\"label\"]\n    input_ids = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n    pred = model(input_ids)\n    pred = torch.softmax(pred.logits, dim=0)\n    submission.loc[idx] = pred.tolist()\n    acc += int(torch.argmax(pred).item() == label)\nprint(\"Accuracy: \", acc/len(imdb[\"test\"]))\nsubmission.to_csv('submission.csv', index_label='idx')\n```",

        The edited file is saved to train.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model has been trained and the next step is to evaluate it and save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py by adding code to evaluate the model and print accuracy on the test set, and also save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff is provided for review.
