Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The model has been evaluated and the accuracy on the test set has been printed. The predictions of probabilities per class have been saved to submission.csv.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it. Done.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset. Done.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. Done.




Fact Check: 
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
4. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:  I have completed all the steps in the research plan. I should submit my answer.
Action:  Final Answer
Action Input:  {
    "final_answer": "I have successfully fine-tuned DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. I have also saved per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        end
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
