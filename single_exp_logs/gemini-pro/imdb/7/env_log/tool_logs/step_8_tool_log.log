===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset, preprocess it, fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent looks for the information in the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent finds the code for loading the dataset and saving per class probabilities, but it does not find any code for preprocessing the data or fine-tuning DistilBERT.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent has decided to list the files in the current directory to get an overview of the files present.
[Action]: The agent executed the "List Files" action with the following input:
```
{
    "dir_path": "."
}
```
[Observation]: The agent observed the following files in the current directory:
```
backup/
research_log.log
train.py
```



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous observation indicated that the next step is to load the dataset. The action is to add the code to load the dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library to the beginning of the script.

[Action]: The code `import datasets` is added to the beginning of the script to import the `datasets` library. The code `dataset = datasets.load_dataset("imdb")` is added to load the IMDB dataset from the `datasets` library.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code to load the dataset is added to the beginning of the script.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The dataset needs to be preprocessed before it can be used for training the model.
[Action]: The script train.py is edited to add code that preprocesses the data by converting the text to lowercase and removing punctuation.
[Observation]: The edited file train.py is saved. The diff shows that the code for preprocessing the data is added to the script.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:
