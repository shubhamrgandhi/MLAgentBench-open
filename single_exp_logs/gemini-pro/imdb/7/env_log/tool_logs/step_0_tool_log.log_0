    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How to load the dataset and preprocess it, how to fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset, and how to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 8)
   - The specific dataset being loaded is the IMDB dataset, which is a sentiment analysis dataset. (Line 8)


- **Preprocessing the Data**:
   - In this segment, I cannot find any specific instructions or code for preprocessing the data.


- **Fine-tuning DistilBERT**:
   - In this segment, I cannot find any specific instructions or code for fine-tuning DistilBERT.


- **Saving Per Class Probabilities**:
   - The per class probabilities for test set examples are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Line 25)
   - The CSV file has two columns, one for the index of the example and one for the predicted probabilities for each class. (Line 23)
   - The probabilities are saved as a list of floats, with each element representing the probability for a specific class. (Line 24)
