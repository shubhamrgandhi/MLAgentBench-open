Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset, preprocess it, fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent looks for the information in the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent finds the code for loading the dataset and saving per class probabilities, but it does not find any code for preprocessing the data or fine-tuning DistilBERT.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent has decided to list the files in the current directory to get an overview of the files present.
[Action]: The agent executed the "List Files" action with the following input:
```
{
    "dir_path": "."
}
```
[Observation]: The agent observed the following files in the current directory:
```
backup/
research_log.log
train.py
```



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous observation indicated that the next step is to load the dataset. The action is to add the code to load the dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library to the beginning of the script.

[Action]: The code `import datasets` is added to the beginning of the script to import the `datasets` library. The code `dataset = datasets.load_dataset("imdb")` is added to load the IMDB dataset from the `datasets` library.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code to load the dataset is added to the beginning of the script.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The dataset needs to be preprocessed before it can be used for training the model.
[Action]: The script train.py is edited to add code that preprocesses the data by converting the text to lowercase and removing punctuation.
[Observation]: The edited file train.py is saved. The diff shows that the code for preprocessing the data is added to the script.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The AI assistant is instructed to edit the script `train.py` to define the model using the `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` functions from the `transformers` library.

[Action]: The AI assistant edits the script `train.py` by adding the following code:

```python
# Define the model
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
```

[Observation]: The AI assistant confirms that the edited file is saved to `train.py` and provides the diff of the edited file. The diff shows that the code to define the model is added to the script.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The model has been defined and the next step is to train it. The `Trainer` class from the `datasets` library can be used to train the model.
[Action]: The following code was added to the `train.py` script:
```python
# Train the model
from datasets import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(model=model, train_dataset=dataset['train'], eval_dataset=dataset['test'], epochs=3, batch_size=32)
trainer.train()
```
[Observation]: The edited file was saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the code to train the model using the `Trainer` class was added.
