Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset, preprocess it, fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset, and save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent looks for the information in the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent finds the code for loading the dataset and saving per class probabilities, but it does not find any code for preprocessing the data or fine-tuning DistilBERT.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent has decided to list the files in the current directory to get an overview of the files present.
[Action]: The agent executed the "List Files" action with the following input:
```
{
    "dir_path": "."
}
```
[Observation]: The agent observed the following files in the current directory:
```
backup/
research_log.log
train.py
```
