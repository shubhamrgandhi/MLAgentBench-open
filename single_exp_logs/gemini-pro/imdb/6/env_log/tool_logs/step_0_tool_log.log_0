    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: What is the IMDb dataset? How is it loaded? How are predictions saved to submission.csv?
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The IMDb dataset is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels.
- It is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 7)


- Predictions are saved to `submission.csv` using the `to_csv` method of a Pandas DataFrame. (Line 25)
- The DataFrame is created with two columns, one for the index and one for the predicted probabilities. (Line 20)
- The index is populated with the indices of the test data. (Line 21)
- The predicted probabilities are obtained by applying the softmax function to the model's output. (Line 18)
- The model's output is obtained by calling the model with the text of the review. (Line 17)
- The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels and dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. (Line 15)
