===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand the IMDb dataset, how it is loaded, and how predictions are saved to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent asks to understand the file train.py.
[Observation]: The IMDb dataset is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels. It is loaded using the load_dataset function from the datasets library. Predictions are saved to submission.csv using the to_csv method of a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is created with two columns, one for the index and one for the predicted probabilities. The index is populated with the indices of the test data. The predicted probabilities are obtained by applying the softmax function to the model's output. The model's output is obtained by calling the model with the text of the review. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels and dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The previous observation indicated that the next step is to load the dataset and preprocess it.
[Action]: The agent executed a script named "train.py".
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a TypeError, indicating that the model variable is not callable.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The script failed to execute because the `model` variable was not defined.
[Action]: Added the following line before the line that says `pred = model(text)`:
```
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the line was added as instructed.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed due to a NameError, indicating that the variable 'AutoModelForSequenceClassification' is not defined.
[Action]: The script "train.py" was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a Traceback error with the message "NameError: name 'AutoModelForSequenceClassification' is not defined".
