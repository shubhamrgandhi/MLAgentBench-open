Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand the IMDb dataset, how it is loaded, and how predictions are saved to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent asks to understand the file train.py.
[Observation]: The IMDb dataset is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels. It is loaded using the load_dataset function from the datasets library. Predictions are saved to submission.csv using the to_csv method of a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is created with two columns, one for the index and one for the predicted probabilities. The index is populated with the indices of the test data. The predicted probabilities are obtained by applying the softmax function to the model's output. The model's output is obtained by calling the model with the text of the review. The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels and dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions.
