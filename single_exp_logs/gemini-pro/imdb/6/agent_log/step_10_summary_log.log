===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The parent directory is still not in the work directory. I cannot list the files in the parent directory.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.












Fact Check:       
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:       I should try to change the current working directory to the parent directory again.
Action:       Copy File
Action Input:       {
    "source": "train.py",
    "destination": "../train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: cannot access file ../train.py because it is not in the work directory.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous action failed because the file was not in the work directory.
[Action]: Copy the file "train.py" to the parent directory.
[Observation]: The action failed because the file is not in the work directory.
