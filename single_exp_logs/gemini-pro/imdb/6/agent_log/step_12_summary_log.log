Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:        The edit is correct and desirable. The current working directory is now changed to the parent directory.
Research Plan and Status:        
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.














Fact Check:        
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:        I should try to run the script again.
Action:        Execute Script
Action Input:        {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous observation indicated that the script had been executed, but the specific output was not provided. To gain more insights, it is necessary to execute the script again and examine the output.
[Action]: The script "train.py" was executed.
[Observation]: Upon executing the script, an error message was displayed, indicating that the dataset "imdb" could not be loaded. The error message suggests that the necessary data files for the dataset were not found.
