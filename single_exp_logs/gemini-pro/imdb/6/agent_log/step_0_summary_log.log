Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the dataset.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.


Fact Check:  
1. This is guessed.
2. This is guessed.
3. This is guessed.
4. This is guessed.
Thought:  I should first understand the problem and the dataset.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "train.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "What is the IMDb dataset? How is it loaded? How are predictions saved to submission.csv?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        - The IMDb dataset is a collection of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels.
- It is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 7)


- Predictions are saved to `submission.csv` using the `to_csv` method of a Pandas DataFrame. (Line 25)
- The DataFrame is created with two columns, one for the index and one for the predicted probabilities. (Line 20)
- The index is populated with the indices of the test data. (Line 21)
- The predicted probabilities are obtained by applying the softmax function to the model's output. (Line 18)
- The model's output is obtained by calling the model with the text of the review. (Line 17)
- The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels and dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. (Line 15)

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
