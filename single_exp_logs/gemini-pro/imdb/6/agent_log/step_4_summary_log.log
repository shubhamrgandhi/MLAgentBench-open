===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script failed to execute again because the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class is not defined. I need to install the necessary library to use this class.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:    I should install the necessary library to use the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class.
Action:    Undo Edit Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Content of train.py after undo the most recent edit:
from datasets import load_dataset
import torch
import pandas as pd

if __name__ == "__main__":
    imdb = load_dataset("imdb")

    #TODO: preprocess data

    #TODO: define model here
    model = None

    #TODO: train model

    #evaluate model and print accuracy on test set, also save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv
    submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(imdb["test"])))
    acc = 0
    for idx, data in enumerate(imdb["test"]):
        text = data["text"]
        label = data["label"]
        pred = model(text) # TODO: replace with proper prediction
        pred = torch.softmax(pred, dim=0)
        submission.loc[idx] = pred.tolist()
        acc += int(torch.argmax(pred).item() == label)
    print("Accuracy: ", acc/len(imdb["test"]))
    
    submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index_label='idx')
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script failed to execute because the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class is not defined. The action is to undo the edit script to revert to a previous state where the script was functional.

[Action]: The action is to undo the edit script named "train.py".

[Observation]: The content of "train.py" after undoing the most recent edit is provided. The script now includes necessary imports and defines a basic structure for training a model on the IMDB dataset. However, it still lacks the definition of the model and the implementation of training and evaluation.
