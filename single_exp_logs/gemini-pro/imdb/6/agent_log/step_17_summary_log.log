===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The script failed to execute due to a `DataFilesNotFoundError` indicating that the IMDb dataset is not found.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.


Fact Check: 
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:  I should try to download the IMDb dataset.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": "D:\\TCSCodify\\MLAgentBench-open\\workspaces\\single_exp_logs\\gemini-pro\\imdb\\6\\imdb"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        backup/
research_log.log
train.py

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous observation indicated that the IMDb dataset was not found. To resolve this issue, I need to list the files in the directory where the dataset is expected to be located to check if it exists.
[Action]: I listed the files in the directory "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\imdb\6\imdb".
[Observation]: The directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- research_log.log
- train.py

The IMDb dataset is not present in this directory.
