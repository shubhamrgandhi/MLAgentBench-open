===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. I have added the line that defines the model before the line that uses it.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:    I can now execute the script again.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\imdb\6\imdb\train.py", line 11, in <module>
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'AutoModelForSequenceClassification' is not defined

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed due to a NameError, indicating that the variable 'AutoModelForSequenceClassification' is not defined.
[Action]: The script "train.py" was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a Traceback error with the message "NameError: name 'AutoModelForSequenceClassification' is not defined".
