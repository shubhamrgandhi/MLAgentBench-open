===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:          The script failed to execute due to a `FileNotFoundError` indicating that the necessary data files for the IMDb dataset were not found.
Research Plan and Status:          
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.


















Fact Check:          
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:          I should try to download the IMDb dataset.
Action:          Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:          {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following line at the beginning of the script:\n\n```\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n```",
    "save_name": "train.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
