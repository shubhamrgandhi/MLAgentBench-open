===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The undo edit script action successfully reverted the previous edit.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:     
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:     I should install the necessary library to use the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class.
Action:     List Files
Action Input:     {
    "dir_path": ".."
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: cannot access file .. because it is not in the work directory.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
