===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit is correct and desirable. It fixes the error in line 21 of the `train.py` script.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect the data.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:     
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is a guess.
4. This is a guess.
Thought:     I should run the `train.py` script again to see if the error is fixed.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\imdb\3\imdb\train.py", line 21, in <module>
    pred = model(torch.tensor([text])) # replace with proper prediction
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: too many dimensions 'str'

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous observation indicated that the error in line 21 of the `train.py` script was fixed. However, executing the script again revealed that the error still exists.
[Action]: Executed the `train.py` script.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a `ValueError: too many dimensions 'str'` error on line 21 of the script.
