===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The error is still not fixed. The new error is `ValueError: too many dimensions 'str'` on line 21 of the `train.py` script.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect the data.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
5. Run the `train.py` script again to see if the error is fixed.
6. Debug the `train.py` script again to find the cause of the new error.





Fact Check:  
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is a guess.
4. This is a guess.
5. This is a guess.
**6. This is a guess.**
Thought:   I should debug the `train.py` script again to find the cause of the new error.
Action:   Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:  
```
{
    "script_name": "train.py",

        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 27):

if __name__ == "__main__":
    imdb = load_dataset("imdb")

    #TODO: preprocess data

    #TODO: define model here
    model = None

    #TODO: train model

    #evaluate model and print accuracy on test set, also save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv
    submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(imdb["test"])))
    acc = 0
    for idx, data in enumerate(imdb["test"]):
        text = data["text"]
        label = data["label"]
        pred = model(torch.tensor([text]).unsqueeze(0)) # replace with proper prediction
        pred = torch.softmax(pred, dim=0)
        submission.loc[idx] = pred.tolist()
        acc += int(torch.argmax(pred).item() == label)
    print("Accuracy: ", acc/len(imdb["test"]))

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error is on line 21 of the `train.py` script, so I should inspect the lines around line 21 to find the cause of the error.
[Action]: I inspected the lines around line 21 of the `train.py` script.
[Observation]: The code on line 21 is `submission.loc[idx] = pred.tolist()`. This line is trying to assign a list of probabilities to a single cell in the `submission` DataFrame. However, the `tolist()` method returns a list of lists, so the assignment is failing.
