===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     There is a new error in the `train.py` script. The error is `ValueError: too many dimensions 'str'` on line 21 of the script.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect the data.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.












Fact Check:      
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is a guess.
4. This is a guess.
Thought:      I should debug the `train.py` script again to find the cause of the new error.
Action:      Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:      {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 1,
    "end_line_number": 25
}

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error is on line 21 of the script, so I should inspect the lines around line 21 to find the cause of the error.
[Action]: I inspected lines 1 to 25 of the script.
[Observation]:
