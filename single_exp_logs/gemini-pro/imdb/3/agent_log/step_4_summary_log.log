Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The error is in line 21 of the `train.py` script. The `model` variable is `None`, which is why the `model(text)` call fails.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Load the dataset and inspect the data.
3. Fine-tune DistilBERT on the dataset.
4. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:     
1. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. This is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. This is a guess.
4. This is a guess.
Thought:     I should fix the error in the `train.py` script.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error in the `train.py` script is that the `model` variable is `None`, which is why the `model(text)` call fails. To fix this, the `model` variable needs to be initialized with the DistilBERT model.
[Action]: Edited the `train.py` script to fix the error. In line 21, replaced `pred = model(text)` with `pred = model(torch.tensor([text]))`.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train.py`. The diff shows that the edit was made correctly.
