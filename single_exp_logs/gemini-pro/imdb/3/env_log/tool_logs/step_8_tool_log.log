===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand how to load the dataset and save predictions to submission.csv.
[Action]: The agent provides the file name "train.py" and specifies that it wants to look for information on how to load the dataset and save predictions to submission.csv.
[Observation]: The observation provides a detailed explanation of how the dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and used to train and evaluate a model. It also explains how the predictions are saved to a CSV file named submission.csv. However, the observation does not contain any information on how to load the dataset and save predictions to submission.csv.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to load the dataset and inspect the data.
[Action]: The agent lists the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- research_log.log
- train.py



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous observation showed that the `train.py` file exists in the current directory. Therefore, executing the script should be possible.
[Action]: The script `train.py` was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a `TypeError` exception. The error message indicates that the `model` variable is `None`, which means that the model was not properly loaded or initialized.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The error `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` occurs when the `model` variable is `None`. To debug the `train.py` script, I need to inspect the lines where the `model` variable is defined and used.
[Action]: I inspected lines 1 to 25 of the `train.py` script.
[Observation]:
```
Here are the lines (the file ends at line 27):

from datasets import load_dataset
import torch
import pandas as pd

if __name__ == "__main__":
    imdb = load_dataset("imdb")

    #TODO: preprocess data

    #TODO: define model here
    model = None

    #TODO: train model

    #evaluate model and print accuracy on test set, also save the predictions of probabilities per class to submission.csv
    submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(imdb["test"])))
    acc = 0
    for idx, data in enumerate(imdb["test"]):
        text = data["text"]
        label = data["label"]
        pred = model(text) # TODO: replace with proper prediction
        pred = torch.softmax(pred, dim=0)
        submission.loc[idx] = pred.tolist()
        acc += int(torch.argmax(pred).item() == label)
    print("Accuracy: ", acc/len(imdb["test"]))
```


```
Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library.
- The model is defined as `None` and needs to be properly loaded or initialized.
- The model is used to make predictions on the test set, and the predictions are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`.
- The accuracy of the model on the test set is calculated and printed.
