    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How to load the dataset and save prediction to subission.csv
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The dataset is loaded using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library. (Line 8)


- The dataset is preprocessed, but the details of the preprocessing are not provided in the given code segment. (Line 10)


- The model is defined, but the details of the model architecture and training are not provided in the given code segment. (Line 12)


- The model is evaluated on the test set, and the accuracy is calculated. The predictions of probabilities per class are saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Lines 16-25)


- The `submission` DataFrame is created with two columns and a number of rows equal to the length of the test set. (Line 17)


- For each data point in the test set, the text and label are extracted. (Line 19)


- The model is used to make a prediction on the text. (Line 20)


- The prediction is converted to a probability distribution using the softmax function. (Line 21)


- The prediction is appended to the `submission` DataFrame. (Line 22)


- The accuracy is calculated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels. (Line 23)


- The accuracy is printed to the console. (Line 24)


- The `submission` DataFrame is saved to a CSV file named `submission.csv`. (Line 25)

In this segment, I cannot find:
- The details of the data preprocessing.
- The details of the model architecture and training.
