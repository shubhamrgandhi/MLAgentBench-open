===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The observation shows an error message: "401 Client Error: Unauthorized". It seems that the authentication is still not working.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Evaluate the improved performance.










Fact Check:      
1. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
2. **The inference script is run again, but it still failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error.**
3. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
4. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
Thought:       I should try to fix the authentication issue.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively

        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The authentication error is likely caused by a missing or invalid Hugging Face token. Adding the token to the environment variables should fix the issue.
[Action]: Edited the inference script inference.py by adding the following code at the beginning of the script:

```python
import os
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "<your_huggingface_token>"
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to inference.py. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.
