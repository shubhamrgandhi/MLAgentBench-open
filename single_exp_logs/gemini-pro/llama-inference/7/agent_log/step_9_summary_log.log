===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The observation shows another "401 Client Error: Unauthorized" error. It seems that the authentication is still not working.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Evaluate the improved performance.












Fact Check:       
1. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
2. **The inference script is run again, but it still failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error.**
3. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
4. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
Thought:        I should try to fix the authentication issue again.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous authentication attempt failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error. This suggests that the authentication token used in the inference script is incorrect or invalid. To fix this, a new authentication token needs to be generated and used in the script.
[Action]: The inference script inference.py is edited to add the following code at the beginning of the script:

```python
import os
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "huggingface_token"
```

This code sets the environment variable HF_TOKEN to the value "huggingface_token". This environment variable is used by the Hugging Face library to authenticate requests to the Hugging Face API. The value "huggingface_token" is a placeholder for the actual authentication token, which should be replaced with the correct token before running the script.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to inference.py. The diff between the original file and the edited file is shown, highlighting the added code.
