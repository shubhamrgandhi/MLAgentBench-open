===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:         The observation shows another "401 Client Error: Unauthorized" error. It seems that the authentication is still not working.
Research Plan and Status:         
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Evaluate the improved performance.
















Fact Check:         
1. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
2. **The inference script is run again, but it still failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error.**
3. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
4. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
Thought:          I should try to fix the authentication issue again.
Action:          Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:          {
    "script_name": "inference.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following code at the beginning of the script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"huggingface_token\"\n```",
    "save_name": "inference.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to inference.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous authentication attempt failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error. The error message suggests that the authentication token is missing or invalid. To fix this, the authentication token needs to be added to the environment variables.
[Action]: The inference script inference.py is edited to add the following code at the beginning of the script:

```python
import os
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "huggingface_token"
```

The edited script is saved as inference.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to inference.py. The diff of the edited file is shown, but the correctness and desirability of the edit are not confirmed.
