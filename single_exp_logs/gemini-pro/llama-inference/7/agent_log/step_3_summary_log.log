===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation shows the diff of the edited script. I need to check if the edit is correct and desirable.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Evaluate the improved performance.






Fact Check:    
1. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
2. **The inference script is edited to add the Hugging Face token.**
Thought:     I should run the inference script again to see if it works now.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "inference.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\2671148\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\llama-inference\7\llama-inference\inference.py", line 3, in <module>

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AttributeError: type object 'HfFolder' has no attribute 'set_token'. Did you mean: 'get_token'?

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The inference script was edited to add the Hugging Face token, so it needs to be run again to see if it works now.
[Action]: The inference script "inference.py" was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in an error: "AttributeError: type object 'HfFolder' has no attribute 'set_token'. Did you mean: 'get_token'?"

Number of prompt tokens: 405
Number of sampled tokens: 86
