===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The observation shows the content of the script after undoing the edit. The error is gone.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Evaluate the improved performance.








Fact Check:     
1. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
2. **The inference script is edited to add the Hugging Face token, but it resulted in an error: "AttributeError: type object 'HfFolder' has no attribute 'set_token'. Did you mean: 'get_token'?"**
3. **The edit is undone and the error is gone.**
Thought:      I should try to add the Hugging Face token again, but this time I will use the correct method.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:      {
    "script_name": "inference.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following code at the beginning of the script:\n\n```python\nimport huggingface_hub\n\nhuggingface_hub.HfFolder.get_token()\n```",

}

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous edit to the inference script resulted in an error. The error message suggests that the method `set_token` does not exist for the class `HfFolder`. To fix this, the method name should be changed to `get_token`.

[Action]: Edited the inference script `inference.py` by adding the following code at the beginning of the script:

```python
import huggingface_hub

huggingface_hub.HfFolder.get_token()
```

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `inference.py`. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.
