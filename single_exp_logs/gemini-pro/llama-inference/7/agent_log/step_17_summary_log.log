===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:           The observation shows another "401 Client Error: Unauthorized" error. It seems that the authentication is still not working.
Research Plan and Status:           
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Evaluate the improved performance.




















Fact Check:           
1. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
2. **The inference script is run again, but it still failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error.**
3. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
4. This is a high level plan. No facts to check.
Thought:            I should try to fix the authentication issue again.
Action:            Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:            {
    "script_name": "inference.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following code at the beginning of the script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"huggingface_token\"\n```",
    "save_name": "inference.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:

        The edited file is saved to inference.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous authentication attempt failed due to a 401 Client Error: Unauthorized error. The authentication token may not have been set correctly.
[Action]: Edited the inference script inference.py to add the following code at the beginning of the script:

```python
import os
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "huggingface_token"
```

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to inference.py. The diff is shown, but it is not included in the observation.
