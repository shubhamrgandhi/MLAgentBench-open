Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the inference script and the current generation speed per token, I need to look at the code.
[Action]: Read the inference script named "inference.py" and look for information about how to run the script, the current generation speed per token, and the model being used.
[Observation]: The observation is the content of the inference script. The specific pre-trained model, tokenizer, evaluation dataset, batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric are not explicitly stated in the provided code.
