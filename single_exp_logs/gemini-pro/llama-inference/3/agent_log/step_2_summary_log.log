===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The inference script failed to run because it could not find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.
Research Plan and Status:   
* High Level Plan:
    * Understand the inference script and the current generation speed per token.
    * Research the accelerate library and see if it can be used to improve the speed.
    * Experiment with the accelerate library to see if it can improve the speed.
    * If the accelerate library does not improve the speed, explore other ways to improve the speed.
* Current Status:
    * Understood the inference script.
    * The current generation speed per token is not explicitly stated in the provided code.
    * The inference script failed to run because it could not find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.




Fact Check:    No objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status.
Thought:    I should try to find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers that are being used in the inference script.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The inference script failed to run because it could not find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers. The current directory contains a backup folder, an inference script, and a research log.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- inference.py
- research_log.log
===================tokens=====================
Number of prompt tokens: 350
Number of sampled tokens: 81
