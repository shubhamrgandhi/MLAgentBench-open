===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The pre-trained model and the tokenizers are not in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:  
* High Level Plan:
    * Understand the inference script and the current generation speed per token.
    * Research the PeFT library and see if it can be used to improve the speed.
    * Experiment with the PeFT library to see if it can improve the speed.
    * If the PeFT library does not improve the speed, explore other ways to improve the speed.
* Current Status:
    * Understood the inference script.
    * The current generation speed per token is not explicitly stated in the provided code.
    * The inference script failed to run because it could not find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.
    * The pre-trained model and the tokenizers are not in the current directory.
    * The inference script imports the necessary libraries and classes for running the inference.
    * The generation length is set to 1.
    * The backup/ directory does not contain the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.






Fact Check:   **The backup/ directory does not contain the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.** is confirmed by the observation.
Thought:   I should try to find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers online.
Action:   List Files
Action Input:   {
    "dir_path": "."
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        backup/
inference.py
research_log.log

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The pre-trained model and the tokenizers are not in the current directory. I should list the files in the current directory to see if they are present.
[Action]: Listed the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files:
- backup/
- inference.py
- research_log.log
===================tokens=====================
Number of prompt tokens: 420
Number of sampled tokens: 76
