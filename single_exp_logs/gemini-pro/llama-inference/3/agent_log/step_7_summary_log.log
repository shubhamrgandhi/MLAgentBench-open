===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The pre-trained model and the tokenizers are not in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:   
* High Level Plan:
    * Understand the inference script and the current generation speed per token.
    * Research the PeFT library and see if it can be used to improve the speed.
    * Experiment with the PeFT library to see if it can improve the speed.
    * If the PeFT library does not improve the speed, explore other ways to improve the speed.
* Current Status:
    * Understood the inference script.
    * The current generation speed per token is not explicitly stated in the provided code.
    * The inference script failed to run because it could not find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.
    * The pre-trained model and the tokenizers are not in the current directory.
    * The inference script imports the necessary libraries and classes for running the inference.
    * The generation length is set to 1.
    * The backup/ directory does not contain the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.
    * The current directory does not contain the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.








Fact Check:    **The current directory does not contain the pre-trained model and the tokenizers.** is confirmed by the observation.
Thought:    I should try to find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers online.
Action:    Final Answer
Action Input:    {
    "final_answer": "I cannot find the pre-trained model and the tokenizers. Therefore, I cannot run the inference script to see the current generation speed per token or try to improve it with the PeFT library."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        end
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action was to provide a final answer to the task.
[Action]: The action taken was to provide a final answer stating that the pre-trained model and tokenizers could not be found, and therefore the inference script could not be run to determine the current generation speed per token or to experiment with the PeFT library to improve it.
[Observation]: The observation was that the end of the conversation had been reached.
