===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The script failed to run again with the same error message "Repository Not Found for url: https://huggingface.co/google/lama-large/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json". This indicates that the script is still unable to access the pre-trained Llama-7b model from Hugging Face's model hub.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library:
    - Understand the purpose of the inference script and the accelerate library.
    - Identify the current generation speed per token.
2. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library:
    - Follow the instructions in the accelerate library documentation to integrate it with the inference script.
    - Run the inference script with the accelerate library and observe the generation speed per token.
    - If the generation speed per token is not improved, try different configurations of the accelerate library.
3. If the generation speed per token is still not improved, try other ways to improve the speed:
    - Profile the inference script to identify bottlenecks.
    - Optimize the code to remove bottlenecks.
    - Try different hardware configurations.








Fact Check:      
- **"Run the inference script with the accelerate library and observe the generation speed per token."** is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:      I should now try to find out why the script is unable to access the pre-trained Llama-7b model from Hugging Face's model hub.
Action:      Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:      {
    "script_name": "inference_accelerate_fixed.py",
    "start_line_number": 21,
    "end_line_number": 25
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 67):

context_length = 128

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/lama-large")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("google/lama-large").to("cuda")
eval_dataset = load_dataset("wikitext", 'wikitext-103-v1', split="test")
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script is unable to access the pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model hub. The error message "Repository Not Found for url: https://huggingface.co/google/lama-large/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json" indicates that the script is trying to access a non-existent URL.
[Action]: Inspected lines 21-25 of the script inference_accelerate_fixed.py.
[Observation]: The script is trying to load the tokenizer and model from the Hugging Face model hub using the from_pretrained() method. The URL for the tokenizer configuration file is "https://huggingface.co/google/lama-large/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json", which is not a valid URL.
