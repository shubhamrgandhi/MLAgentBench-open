===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:           The observation suggests that the correct URL for the tokenizer configuration file can be found on the Hugging Face model hub.
Research Plan and Status:           
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library:
    - Understand the purpose of the inference script and the accelerate library.
    - Identify the current generation speed per token.
2. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library:
    - Follow the instructions in the accelerate library documentation to integrate it with the inference script.
    - Run the inference script with the accelerate library and observe the generation speed per token.
    - If the generation speed per token is not improved, try different configurations of the accelerate library.
3. If the generation speed per token is still not improved, try other ways to improve the speed:
    - Profile the inference script to identify bottlenecks.
    - Optimize the code to remove bottlenecks.
    - Try different hardware configurations.




















Fact Check:            
- **"Run the inference script with the accelerate library and observe the generation speed per token."** is directly confirmed by the previous observation.
Thought:            I should now try to find the correct URL for the tokenizer configuration file on the Hugging Face model hub.
Action:            Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:            {
    "script_name": "inference_accelerate_fixed.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Replace the incorrect URL for the tokenizer configuration file with the correct URL.",
    "save_name": "inference_accelerate_fixed_url.py"
} 
        [Observation]:

        The edited file is saved to inference_accelerate_fixed_url.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The observation suggests that the correct URL for the tokenizer configuration file can be found on the Hugging Face model hub.
[Action]: Edited the inference script inference_accelerate_fixed.py to replace the incorrect URL for the tokenizer configuration file with the correct URL. The edited file is saved as inference_accelerate_fixed_url.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to inference_accelerate_fixed_url.py. The diff between the original file and the edited file is provided.
