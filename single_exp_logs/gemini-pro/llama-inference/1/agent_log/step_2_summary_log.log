===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The inference script failed to run due to an error. The error message indicates that the script is trying to access a private repository without proper authentication.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the accelerate library. Done.
2. Run the inference script to get the baseline performance. Failed due to authentication error.
3. Try to improve the generation speed per token with accelerate library.
4. Run the inference script again to see if the generation speed per token has improved.
5. If the generation speed per token has not improved, try other ways to improve it.






Fact Check:    No new objective statements.
Thought:    I need to fix the authentication error before I can run the inference script.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "inference.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following lines to the beginning of the script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"<your_token>\"\n```",

}

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The inference script failed to run due to an authentication error. Adding the HF_TOKEN environment variable with the appropriate token should fix the authentication error.
[Action]: Edited the inference script inference.py by adding the following lines to the beginning of the script:

```python
import os
os.environ["HF_TOKEN"] = "<your_token>"
```

Saved the edited file as inference_with_token.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to inference_with_token.py. The diff shows that the lines were added to the beginning of the script as instructed.
