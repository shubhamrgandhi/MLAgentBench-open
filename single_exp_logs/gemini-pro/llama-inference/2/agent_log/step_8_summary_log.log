===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The execution of the script with the accelerate library resulted in an error: "401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://huggingface.co/decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf/resolve/main/tokenizer_config.json". This error suggests that the specified repository is not accessible or does not exist.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the inference script inference.py and the current generation speed per token.
2. Research the accelerate library and how it can be used to improve the generation speed.
3. Implement the accelerate library in the inference script and measure the new generation speed.
4. If the new generation speed is not satisfactory, try other ways to improve the speed.

5. Use a more efficient tokenizer, a smaller model, a faster hardware accelerator, and optimize the inference script.
6. Try using a more efficient transformer model, a faster GPU, a faster version of the transformer library, a more efficient data loader, a more efficient inference script, and a technique called "beam search".




Fact Check:  
1. The problem is to improve the generation speed per token of the inference script inference.py. (guessed)
2. The accelerate library can be used to improve the generation speed. (guessed)
Thought:   I should try to use a more efficient tokenizer, a smaller model, a faster hardware accelerator, and optimize the inference script. I should also try using a more efficient transformer model, a faster GPU, a faster version of the transformer library, a more efficient data loader, a more efficient inference script, and a technique called "beam search".
