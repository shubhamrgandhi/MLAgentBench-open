Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit is correct and desirable. It changes the logistic regression model to a decision tree model.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiments and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.










Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: I need to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
2. Directly confirmed: I need to design experiments to address the problem.
3. Directly confirmed: I need to implement the experiments and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Thought:      I should now execute the script to see the performance of the decision tree model.
Action:      Execute Script
Action Input:      {
    "script_name": "train_decision_tree.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train Accuracy: 0.7427646953082869
Validation Accuracy: 0.7251798561151079

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
