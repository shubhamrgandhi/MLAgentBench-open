Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset to proceed with the research plan.
[Action]: Read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task description, dataset description, and evaluation metric.
[Observation]: The agent found the task description, dataset description, but could not find information about the evaluation metric.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to design experiments to address the problem.
[Action]: The agent reflects on the different models and feature selections that can be tried.
[Observation]: There are many different models and feature engineering techniques that can be tried to improve the performance of a machine learning model. Some of the most common models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Feature engineering techniques can be used to improve the quality of the data that is used to train the model, which can also lead to improved performance. Some common feature engineering techniques include data cleaning, feature selection, and feature transformation.
