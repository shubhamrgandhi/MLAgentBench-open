===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows that the edit to the train.py script was successful. The code to load the train.csv and test.csv files was added. However, the code to train the model is still missing.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the task and the dataset. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. In progress.
3. Train and evaluate models.
4. Iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance.
5. Submit the final answer.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: The observation shows that the edit to the train.py script was successful.
Thought:   I should continue editing the train.py script to add the code to train the model.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
"script_name": "train.py",
"edit_instruction": "Add code to train the model using Logistic Regression.",
"save_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:
