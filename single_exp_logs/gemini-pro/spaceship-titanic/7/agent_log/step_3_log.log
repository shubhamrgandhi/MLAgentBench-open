        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],

            "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:

Research Problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.

Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: I have read the task_descriptor.txt file and understood the task and the dataset.
Thought:   I should start by designing experiments to address the problem.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
"things_to_reflect_on": "What experiments can I design to address the problem?"
}


Observation:
```
Reflection: To address the problem of missing evaluation metrics in the task_descriptor.txt file, the agent can design experiments to determine the appropriate evaluation metric for the task. This can be done by considering the following factors:

1. **Task Objective:** The agent should first understand the objective of the task. Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? The objective of the task will determine the appropriate evaluation metric.

2. **Dataset Characteristics:** The agent should also consider the characteristics of the dataset. Is it a balanced dataset or an imbalanced dataset? Does it contain outliers or missing values? The characteristics of the dataset can affect the choice of evaluation metric.

3. **Existing Literature:** The agent can also review the existing literature on the task to see what evaluation metrics have been used in previous studies. This can provide valuable insights into the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task.

Once the agent has considered these factors, it can design experiments to compare different evaluation metrics. This can be done by training and evaluating models using different evaluation metrics and comparing the results. The evaluation metric that produces the most meaningful and informative results is the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task.

Here are some specific experiments that the agent can design:

1. **Experiment 1:** Train and evaluate models using different classification evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare the results to determine which metric provides the most meaningful and informative results.

2. **Experiment 2:** Train and evaluate models using different regression evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Compare the results to determine which metric provides the most meaningful and informative results.

3. **Experiment 3:** Train and evaluate models using different evaluation metrics on different datasets. This will help the agent to understand how the choice of evaluation metric can be affected by the characteristics of the dataset.

By conducting these experiments, the agent can determine the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task. This will allow the agent to design more effective experiments and train models that are better suited to the task.
