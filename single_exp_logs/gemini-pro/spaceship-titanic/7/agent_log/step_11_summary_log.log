===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation shows that the train.py script is trying to access a column named "Cabins" in the train_data DataFrame, but this column does not exist. This is likely the cause of the "KeyError: 'Cabins'" error that was observed when the script was executed.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the task and the dataset. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. In progress.
3. Train and evaluate models.
4. Iteratively improve the model performance.
5. Submit the final answer.










Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The observation shows that the train.py script is trying to access a column named "Cabins" in the train_data DataFrame, but this column does not exist.
Thought:      I should remove the reference to the "Cabins" column from the train.py script.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:     
{
"script_name": "train.py",
"edit_instruction": "Remove the reference to the \"Cabins\" column from the train.py script.",
"save_name": "train.py"
}
