This can be done by considering the following factors:\n\n1. **Task Objective:** The agent should first understand the objective of the task. Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? The objective of the task will determine the appropriate evaluation metric.\n\n2. **Dataset Characteristics:** The agent should also consider the characteristics of the dataset. Is it a balanced dataset or an imbalanced dataset? Does it contain outliers or missing values? The characteristics of the dataset can affect the choice of evaluation metric.\n\n3. **Existing Literature:** The agent can also review the existing literature on the task to see what evaluation metrics have been used in previous studies. This can provide valuable insights into the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task.\n\nOnce the agent has considered these factors, it can design experiments to compare different evaluation metrics. This can be done by training and evaluating models using different evaluation metrics and comparing the results. The evaluation metric that produces the most meaningful and informative results is the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task.\n\nHere are some specific experiments that the agent can design:\n\n1. **Experiment 1:** Train and evaluate models using different classification evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare the results to determine which metric provides the most meaningful and informative results.\n\n2. **Experiment 2:** Train and evaluate models using different regression evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Compare the results to determine which metric provides the most meaningful and informative results.\n\n3. **Experiment 3:** Train and evaluate models using different evaluation metrics on different datasets. This will help the agent to understand how the choice of evaluation metric can be affected by the characteristics of the dataset.\n\nBy conducting these experiments, the agent can determine the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task. This will allow the agent to design more effective experiments and train models that are better suited to the task.\n",

Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\nHomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\nCryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\nCabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\nDestination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\nAge - The age of the passenger.\nVIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\nRoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\nName - The first and last names of the passenger.\nTransported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n\ntest.csv - Personal records for the remaining passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n\nsample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format.\nPassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\nTransported - The target.
