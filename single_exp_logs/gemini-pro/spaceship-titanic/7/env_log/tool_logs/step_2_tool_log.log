We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset before designing experiments and training models.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Observation]: The agent found the task description, dataset description, but not the evaluation metric in the task_descriptor.txt file.

To address the problem of missing evaluation metrics in the task_descriptor.txt file, the agent can design experiments to determine the appropriate evaluation metric for the task. This can be done by considering the following factors:

1. **Task Objective:** The agent should first understand the objective of the task. Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? The objective of the task will determine the appropriate evaluation metric.

2. **Dataset Characteristics:** The agent should also consider the characteristics of the dataset. Is it a balanced dataset or an imbalanced dataset? Does it contain outliers or missing values? The characteristics of the dataset can affect the choice of evaluation metric.

3. **Existing Literature:** The agent can also review the existing literature on the task to see what evaluation metrics have been used in previous studies. This can provide valuable insights into the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task.

Once the agent has considered these factors, it can design experiments to compare different evaluation metrics. This can be done by training and evaluating models using different evaluation metrics and comparing the results. The evaluation metric that produces the most meaningful and informative results is the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task.

Here are some specific experiments that the agent can design:

1. **Experiment 1:** Train and evaluate models using different classification evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Compare the results to determine which metric provides the most meaningful and informative results.

2. **Experiment 2:** Train and evaluate models using different regression evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Compare the results to determine which metric provides the most meaningful and informative results.

3. **Experiment 3:** Train and evaluate models using different evaluation metrics on different datasets. This will help the agent to understand how the choice of evaluation metric can be affected by the characteristics of the dataset.

By conducting these experiments, the agent can determine the most appropriate evaluation metric for the task. This will allow the agent to design more effective experiments and train models that are better suited to the task.
