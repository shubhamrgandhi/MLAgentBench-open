Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset before designing experiments and training models.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Observation]: The agent found the task description, dataset description, but not the evaluation metric in the task_descriptor.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to design experiments to address the problem of missing evaluation metrics in the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Action]: The agent reflects on the factors to consider when designing experiments to determine the appropriate evaluation metric for the task, including the task objective, dataset characteristics, and existing literature. The agent also proposes specific experiments to compare different evaluation metrics.
[Observation]: The agent provides a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind the action, including the factors to consider when designing experiments to determine the appropriate evaluation metric for the task. The agent also proposes specific experiments to compare different evaluation metrics.
