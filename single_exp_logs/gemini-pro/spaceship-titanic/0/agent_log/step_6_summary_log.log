===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The observation shows the training and validation accuracy of different models and feature selections. The best model is LogisticRegression with features ['HomePlanet', 'CryoSleep', 'Destination', 'VIP', 'Deck', 'Side'], which achieved a training accuracy of 0.7199352867158009 and a validation accuracy of 0.7030913012221424.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the task and dataset. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiments and iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance. Done.
4. Evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one. Done.
5. Submit the final answer.










Fact Check:     
- Confirmed: LogisticRegression with features ['HomePlanet', 'CryoSleep', 'Destination', 'VIP', 'Deck', 'Side'] achieved a training accuracy of 0.7199352867158009 and a validation accuracy of 0.7030913012221424.


Thought:     I have found the best model and feature selection. I should submit the final answer.
