===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation shows the diff of the edited script.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the task and dataset. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiments and iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one.
5. Submit the final answer.






Fact Check:    
- Confirmed: Add code to load the training data, preprocess it, and split it into training and validation sets.


Thought:    I should execute the script to see the performance.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train Accuracy: 0.7161603451375157
Validation Accuracy: 0.7223021582733813

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
