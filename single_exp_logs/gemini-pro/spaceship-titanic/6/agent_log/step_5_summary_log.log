===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     I cannot find any additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. Done
2. Design a high level plan to approach the problem. In progress
3. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.








Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: I have read the task_descriptor.txt file and understand the task and the dataset.
Thought:     I should search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task online.
Action:     Reflection
Action Input:     {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What should be the next step?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: The next step should be to search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. Potential sources of information include the task website or documentation, research papers, and online forums and communities.

The agent has already listed the files in the current directory and found no relevant information. Therefore, it should now actively search for additional resources online. This can be done by using search engines, visiting the task website (if available), or searching through research paper databases. The agent should also consider joining online forums and communities dedicated to the task or to machine learning in general, as these can be valuable sources of information and insights.

Once the agent has gathered more information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance, it can then proceed to design a training strategy and evaluate the performance of the model. This may involve experimenting with different models, feature selections, and hyperparameters to optimize the performance of the model.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
