Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I cannot find any additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:   3. Search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task online. In progress
4. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.








Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: I have read the task_descriptor.txt file and understand the task and the dataset.
2. Directly confirmed: I have searched for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task online.
Thought:   I should continue searching for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task online.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To find additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task, I need to list the files in the current directory to see if there are any relevant files.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
