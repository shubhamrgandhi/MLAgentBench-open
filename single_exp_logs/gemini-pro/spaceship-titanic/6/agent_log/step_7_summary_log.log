===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      I cannot find any additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. Done
2. Design a high level plan to approach the problem. In progress
3. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.










Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: I have read the task_descriptor.txt file and understand the task and the dataset.
Thought:      I should search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task online.
Action:      Reflection
Action Input:      {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What should be the next step?"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: The next step should be to actively search for additional resources online that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. Potential sources of information include the task website or documentation, research papers, and online forums and communities.

The agent has already listed the files in the current directory and found no relevant information. Therefore, it should now actively search for additional resources online. This can be done by searching for the task name or the dataset name along with keywords such as "evaluation metric", "baseline performance", "task documentation", or "research papers". The agent should also check the task website or documentation, if available, as it may contain information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance. Additionally, the agent can search for research papers or blog posts that discuss the task and provide insights into the evaluation metric and baseline performance. Finally, the agent can join online forums or communities dedicated to the task or the dataset, where other researchers or practitioners may have shared their experiences and insights.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
