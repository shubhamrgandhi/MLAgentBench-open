===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    I cannot find any additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. Done
2. Design a high level plan to approach the problem. In progress
3. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: I have read the task_descriptor.txt file and understand the task and the dataset.
Thought:    I should search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task online.
Action:    Reflection
Action Input:    {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What should be the next step?"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: The next step should be to search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. Potential sources of information include the task website or documentation, research papers, and online forums and communities.

The agent should start by checking the task website or documentation to see if there is any information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance. If there is no information available on the task website or documentation, the agent should search for research papers or online forums and communities that discuss the task. The agent should also consider searching for any publicly available code or scripts that have been used to solve the task, as these may contain information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance.

Once the agent has gathered information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance, it can use this information to design a training strategy and evaluate the performance of the model. The agent should also consider iterating over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Action]: Reflection
[Observation]: The agent should search for additional information about the evaluation and performance of the task.
[Explanation]: The agent does not have enough information to proceed with the task. It needs to gather more information about the evaluation and performance of the task in order to design a training strategy and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
