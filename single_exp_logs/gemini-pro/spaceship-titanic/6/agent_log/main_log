Research Problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why

}


Observation:

```
Reflection: The next step should be to search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. This information is crucial for designing a training strategy and evaluating the performance of the model. Without knowing the evaluation metric, it would be difficult to determine whether the model is improving or not. Similarly, without knowing the baseline performance, it would be difficult to assess the effectiveness of the model compared to other approaches.

Potential sources of information include:

* The task website or documentation: Often, tasks have a dedicated website or documentation that provides detailed information about the task, including the evaluation metric and baseline performance.
* Research papers: If the task is well-known, there may be research papers that have been published on the task. These papers often include information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance.
* Online forums and communities: There may be online forums or communities dedicated to the task where users discuss their approaches and share their results. These forums can be a valuable source of information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance.

Once the evaluation metric and baseline performance have been identified, the agent can proceed to the next step of designing a training strategy and implementing the model.
