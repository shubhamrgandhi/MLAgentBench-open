===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 
    Your current research log:
    ```
    

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset before designing a plan to approach the problem.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Observation]: The agent found the task description, dataset description, but not the evaluation metric or baseline performance in the task_descriptor.txt file.

The next step should be to search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. This information is crucial for designing a training strategy and evaluating the performance of the model. Without knowing the evaluation metric, it would be difficult to determine whether the model is improving or not. Similarly, without knowing the baseline performance, it would be difficult to assess the effectiveness of the model compared to other approaches.

Potential sources of information include:

* The task website or documentation: Often, tasks have a dedicated website or documentation that provides detailed information about the task, including the evaluation metric and baseline performance.
* Research papers: If the task is well-known, there may be research papers that have been published on the task. These papers often include information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance.
* Online forums and communities: There may be online forums or communities dedicated to the task where users discuss their approaches and share their results. These forums can be a valuable source of information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance.

Once the evaluation metric and baseline performance have been identified, the agent can proceed to the next step of designing a training strategy and implementing the model.
