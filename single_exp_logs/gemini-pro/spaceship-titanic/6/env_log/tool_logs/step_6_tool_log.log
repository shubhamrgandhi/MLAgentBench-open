===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 
    Your current research log:

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset before designing a plan to approach the problem.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Observation]: The agent found the task description, dataset description, but not the evaluation metric or baseline performance in the task_descriptor.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to find more information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task in order to design a training strategy and evaluate the performance of the model.
[Action]: Reflection
[Observation]: The agent should search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. Potential sources of information include the task website or documentation, research papers, and online forums and communities.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: To find additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task, I need to list the files in the current directory to see if there are any relevant files.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The following files are in the current directory:
- backup/
- research_log.log
- sample_submission.csv
- task_descriptor.txt
- test.csv
- train.csv
- train.py


    ```
    Reflect on this: What should be the next step?

The next step should be to search for additional documentation or resources that provide information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance for the task. Potential sources of information include the task website or documentation, research papers, and online forums and communities.

The agent should start by checking the task website or documentation to see if there is any information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance. If there is no information available on the task website or documentation, the agent should search for research papers or online forums and communities that discuss the task. The agent should also consider searching for any publicly available code or scripts that have been used to solve the task, as these may contain information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance.

Once the agent has gathered information about the evaluation metric and baseline performance, it can use this information to design a training strategy and evaluate the performance of the model. The agent should also consider iterating over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
