Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\nHomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\nCryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\nCabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\nDestination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\nAge - The age of the passenger.\nVIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\nRoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\nName - The first and last names of the passenger.\nTransported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n\ntest.csv - Personal records for the remaining passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n\nsample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format.\nPassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\nTransported - The target.
