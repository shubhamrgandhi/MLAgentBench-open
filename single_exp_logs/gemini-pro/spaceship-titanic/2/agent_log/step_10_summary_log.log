Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The gradient boosting machine model achieved a train accuracy of 0.7310803523278806 and a validation accuracy of 0.7309352517985611. This is a better result compared to the logistic regression model and the decision tree model, but worse than the random forest model.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. (Done)
2. Design experiments to train and evaluate different models. (Done)
3. Iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance. (In progress)
4. Submit the final answer.






Fact Check:   
1. The gradient boosting machine model achieved a train accuracy of 0.7310803523278806 and a validation accuracy of 0.7309352517985611. This is a better result compared to the logistic regression model and the decision tree model, but worse than the random forest model. (Confirmed by the observation)
Thought:    I should try a different model, such as a neural network.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The gradient boosting machine model achieved a better result compared to the logistic regression model and the decision tree model, but worse than the random forest model. It is worth trying a different model, such as a neural network, to see if it can achieve a better performance.

[Action]: Edited the script train.py to add code to train and evaluate a neural network model. The edited file is saved as train_neural_network.py.

[Observation]: The edited file train_neural_network.py is saved. The diff shows that code to train and evaluate a neural network model is added.
