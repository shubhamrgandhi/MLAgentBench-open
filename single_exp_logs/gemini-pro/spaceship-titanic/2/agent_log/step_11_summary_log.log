Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edit is correct and desirable. It adds code to train and evaluate a neural network model.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. (Done)
2. Design experiments to train and evaluate different models. (Done)
3. Iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance. (In progress)
4. Submit the final answer.



Fact Check: 
1. The neural network model achieved a train accuracy of 0.7310803523278806 and a validation accuracy of 0.7309352517985611. This is a better result compared to the logistic regression model and the decision tree model, but worse than the random forest model. (Confirmed by the observation)
Thought:  I should try a different model, such as a support vector machine.
Action:  Edit Script (AI)
Action Input: 
{
"script_name": "train.py",
"edit_instruction": "Add code to train and evaluate a support vector machine model.",
"save_name": "train_support_vector_machine.py"
}

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The current neural network model achieved a train accuracy of 0.7310803523278806 and a validation accuracy of 0.7309352517985611, which is worse than the random forest model. To improve the performance, a different model, such as a support vector machine, should be tried.

[Action]: Edited the script train.py to add code to train and evaluate a support vector machine model. The edited file is saved as train_support_vector_machine.py.

[Observation]: The edited file train_support_vector_machine.py is generated. The diff shows that code to train and evaluate a support vector machine model is added.
