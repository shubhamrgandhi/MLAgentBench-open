===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edit is correct and desirable. It adds code to train and evaluate a decision tree model.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. (Done)
2. Design experiments to train and evaluate different models. (Done)
3. Iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance. (In progress)
4. Submit the final answer.


Fact Check: 
1. I am currently in step 3.
Thought:  I should run the edited script to train and evaluate the decision tree model.
Action:  Execute Script
Action Input:  {
"script_name": "train_decision_tree.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train Accuracy: 0.7427646953082869
Validation Accuracy: 0.7251798561151079

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
