===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. It adds code to train and evaluate a logistic regression model.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file. (Done)
2. Design experiments to train and evaluate different models. (Done)
3. Iterate over different models and feature selections to get a better performance. (In progress)
4. Submit the final answer.








Fact Check:    
1. I am currently in step 3.
Thought:     I should run the edited script to train and evaluate the logistic regression model.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
"script_name": "train_logistic_regression.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train Accuracy: 0.7161603451375157
Validation Accuracy: 0.7223021582733813

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
