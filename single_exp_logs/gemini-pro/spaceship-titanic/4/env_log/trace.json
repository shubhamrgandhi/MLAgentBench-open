This can occur if the model is too simple or if it does not have enough data to learn from.\n* **Overfitting:** The model may be overfitting the data, meaning that it is learning the specific details of the training data too well and is not able to generalize to new data. This can occur if the model is too complex or if it is trained for too long.\n* **Poor feature selection:** The features used to train the model may not be informative or relevant to the task. This can lead to the model making poor predictions, even if it is well-trained.\n* **Imbalanced data:** The training data may be imbalanced, meaning that there are significantly more examples of one class than the other. This can make it difficult for the model to learn to predict the minority class accurately.\n* **Inappropriate model choice:** Logistic regression may not be the most appropriate model for this task. Other models, such as decision trees or random forests, may be better suited to the data and task.\n\nTo improve the performance of the model, it is important to address the underlying cause of the low performance. This may involve adjusting the model parameters, selecting more informative features, or trying a different model altogether.\n",

Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.\nHomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.\nCryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.\nCabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.\nDestination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.\nAge - The age of the passenger.\nVIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.\nRoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.\nName - The first and last names of the passenger.\nTransported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.\n\ntest.csv - Personal records for the remaining passengers, to be used as test data. Your task is to predict the value of Transported for the passengers in this set.\n\nsample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format.\nPassengerId - Id for each passenger in the test set.\nTransported - The target. For each passenger, predict either True or False.",
