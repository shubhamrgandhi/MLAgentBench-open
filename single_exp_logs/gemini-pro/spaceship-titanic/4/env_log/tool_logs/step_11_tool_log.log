We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Action]: The agent tried to list files in the current directory and the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Observation]: The agent received an error message indicating that the action input for List Files needs to be a valid JSON with proper entries.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to list files in the current directory and the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Action]: The action input is a JSON string with a "dir_path" key, which is an array of strings representing the paths to the directories to list files in. In this case, the "dir_path" key has two values: "." and "task_descriptor.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is an error message indicating that the action input is not a valid JSON string. The error message specifies that the JSON string is missing a comma between the two entries in the "dir_path" array.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid JSON with proper entries.
[Action]: List Files
[Observation]: The observation shows that the input JSON string is not valid.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The action is to list files in the current directory and the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Action]: The action input is a JSON object with a "dir_path" key, which is an array of strings representing the paths to the directories to list files in. In this case, the "dir_path" array contains two strings: "." (the current directory) and "task_descriptor.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is an error message indicating that the action input is not a valid JSON object. The error message states that the JSON object is missing a comma between the two entries in the "dir_path" array.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid JSON with proper entries.
[Action]: List Files
[Observation]: The observation shows that the input JSON string is not valid.
