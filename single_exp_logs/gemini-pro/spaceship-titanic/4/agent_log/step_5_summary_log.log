4. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.






Fact Check: 
1. Guessed: I need to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
Thought:  I should use the correct format to list the files.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": [".", "task_descriptor.txt"]
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries. Please use the correct format and try again:
{
            dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
        ```
