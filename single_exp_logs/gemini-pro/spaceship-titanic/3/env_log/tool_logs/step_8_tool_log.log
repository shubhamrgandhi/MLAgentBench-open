We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Action]: The agent tried to list files with the action input:
```
{
    "dir_path": [".", "task_descriptor.txt"]
}
```
[Observation]: The agent received an error message:
```
EnvError: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries. Please use the correct format and try again:
{
            dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
```



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Action]: The agent attempts to list files in the current directory and the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Observation]: The agent receives an error message indicating that the action input for List Files is not in the correct format. The error message provides an example of the correct format.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Action]: The agent tries to list the files in the current directory and the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Observation]: The agent receives an error message indicating that the input format for List Files is not correct and needs to be in a valid JSON format with proper entries.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Action]: The agent tries to list the files in the current directory and the task_descriptor.txt file.
[Observation]: The agent receives an error message indicating that the input format for List Files is not correct and needs to be in a valid JSON format with proper entries.
