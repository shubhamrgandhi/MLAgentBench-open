[Reasoning]: The agent needs to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
[Action]: The agent tried to list files with the action input:
```
{
    "dir_path": [".", "task_descriptor.txt"]
}
```
[Observation]: The agent received an error message:
```
EnvError: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries. Please use the correct format and try again:

            dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
```
