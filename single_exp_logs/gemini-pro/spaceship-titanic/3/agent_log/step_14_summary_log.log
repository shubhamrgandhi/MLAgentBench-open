Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The input format for List Files is not correct. I need to use the correct format.
Research Plan and Status: 
1.  redakce the task and the dataset by reading the task_descriptor.txt file.
2. Design experiments to address the problem.
3. redakce the experiments and iterate over different models or feature redakce to get a better performance.


Fact Check: 
1. Guessed: I need to read the task_descriptor.txt file to understand the task and the dataset.
Thought:  I should use the correct format for List Files to list the files in the current directory.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": [".", "task_descriptor.txt"]
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries. Please use the correct format and try again:
{
            dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
