Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script execution failed with a NameError related to train_accuracy.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the task and the dataset. Done.
2. Come up with a high level plan. In progress.
3. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
4. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.










Fact Check:      
1. The script execution failed with a NameError related to train_accuracy.
Thought:      I need to fix the error related to train_accuracy in the train_regression_fixed.py script.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:      {
"script_name": "train_regression_fixed.py",
"edit_instruction": "Find the line that prints train_accuracy and change it to print val_accuracy instead.",

}

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Action]: Edited the train_regression_script.py script to print val_accuracy instead of train_accuracy.
[Observation]: The script was successfully saved as train_regression_script.py. The diff shows that the line that printed train_accuracy was changed to print val_accuracy.
[Explanation]: The error was related to train_accuracy, so changing the script to print val_accuracy instead should fix the error.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed with a NameError related to train_accuracy. The error message suggests that the variable train_accuracy is not defined in the script. To fix this error, I need to find the line that prints train_accuracy and change it to print val_accuracy instead.

[Action]: I edited the train_regression_fixed.py script to fix the error related to train_accuracy. I found the line that prints train_accuracy and changed it to print val_accuracy instead. I saved the edited file as train_regression_fixed.py.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_regression_fixed.py. The diff shows that the line that prints train_accuracy has been changed to print val_accuracy instead.
