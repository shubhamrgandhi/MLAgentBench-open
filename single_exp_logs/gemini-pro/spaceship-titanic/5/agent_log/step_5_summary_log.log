===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The script execution failed because the script train_regression_fixed.py does not exist.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the task and the dataset. Done.
2. Come up with a high level plan. In progress.
3. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
4. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.








Fact Check:     
1. The script execution failed because the script train_regression_fixed.py does not exist.
Thought:     I need to create the train_regression_fixed.py script.
Action:     Copy File
Action Input:     {
"source": "train_logistic_regression.py",
"destination": "train_regression_fixed.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        File train_logistic_regression.py copied to train_regression_fixed.py
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
