===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The edit script action successfully added code to load the train.csv file, preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and save the model.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the task and the dataset. Done.
2. Come up with a high level plan. In progress.
3. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
4. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.




Fact Check:   
1. The edit script action successfully added code to load the train.csv file, preprocess the data, train a logistic regression model, and save the model.
Thought:   I can now execute the train_logistic_regression.py script to train the model and see the performance.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:   {
"script_name": "train_logistic_regression.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
