    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: The model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, the training epochs, and the data loading process.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
**Model Architecture:**

- The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and a final output layer.
- The convolutional layers use a kernel size of 5 and a stride of 1.
- The fully connected layers have 120 and 84 neurons, respectively.
- The output layer has 10 neurons, corresponding to the 10 classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Optimizer:**

- The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.1 and a momentum of 0.9.

**Loss Function:**

- The loss function used is the Cross-Entropy Loss.

**Training Epochs:**

- The model is trained for 5 epochs.

**Data Loading Process:**

- The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using the `torchvision.datasets` module.
- The data is transformed using the `transforms.Compose()` function, which applies a series of transformations to the data, including converting it to a tensor and normalizing it.
- The data is then split into training and test sets using the `datasets.CIFAR10()` function.
- The training and test sets are loaded into `DataLoader` objects, which are used to iterate over the data in batches during training and testing.

**In this segment, I cannot find:**

- The batch size used for training and testing.
- The number of workers used for data loading.
- The device used for training and testing (CPU or GPU).
