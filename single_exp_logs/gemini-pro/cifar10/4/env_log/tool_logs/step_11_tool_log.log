We are trying to solve this research problem: Given a training script on a dataset train.py, improve upon the current model performance (trained with current hyperparmeters in train.py) for more than 10%. The training epochs should be within 10 to save time. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the training script train.py in order to come up with a plan for improving the performance of the model.
[Action]: The agent decided to understand the file train.py by looking for the model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, the training epochs, and the data loading process.
[Observation]: The agent was able to find information about the model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, and the training epochs. However, the agent was not able to find information about the batch size used for training and testing, the number of workers used for data loading, and the device used for training and testing (CPU or GPU).



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: To establish a baseline performance, I executed the training script train.py.

[Action]: I executed the training script train.py.

[Observation]: The script has been executed. The training process took 5 epochs. The training accuracy reached 56.42% at epoch 4, and the test accuracy reached 53.14% at epoch 4. The final training accuracy was 52.75%, and the final test accuracy was 49.59%.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The training script has been executed and the baseline performance has been established. The training accuracy is 52.75% and the test accuracy is 49.59%. The next step is to inspect the training script to identify potential areas for improvement.
[Action]: Inspected lines 1 to 100 of the training script train.py.
[Observation]: The training script contains the following components:
- Data augmentation transforms using torchvision.transforms.
- A custom neural network model with convolutional and fully connected layers.
- A training loop with 5 epochs, a batch size of 128, and an SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1 and momentum of 0.9.
- A function to evaluate the model's accuracy on a given dataloader.
- Code to print the training and test accuracy after each epoch.
- Code to save the predictions to submission.csv.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The model architecture is simple and may not be able to capture the complexity of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The training epochs are only 5, which may not be enough for the model to converge. The learning rate of the optimizer is fixed at 0.1, which may not be optimal for the model.
[Action]: Edited the training script train.py to increase the number of training epochs to 10, change the learning rate of the optimizer to 0.01, and add a dropout layer after the first fully connected layer. Saved the edited file as train_improved.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_improved.py. The diff shows that the number of training epochs is increased to 10, the learning rate of the optimizer is changed to 0.01, and a dropout layer is added after the first fully connected layer.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The edited training script has been executed to see if the performance improves.
[Action]: The script "train_improved.py" was executed.
[Observation]: The training script ran successfully and produced output. The training accuracy and test accuracy improved over the course of 10 epochs. The final training accuracy was 68.53% and the final test accuracy was 62.63%.
