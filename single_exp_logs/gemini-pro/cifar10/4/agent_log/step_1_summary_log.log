Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the problem and the training script train.py. The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and a final output layer. The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.1 and a momentum of 0.9. The loss function used is the Cross-Entropy Loss. The model is trained for 5 epochs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using the `torchvision.datasets` module. The data is transformed using the `transforms.Compose()` function, which applies a series of transformations to the data, including converting it to a tensor and normalizing it. The data is then split into training and test sets using the `datasets.CIFAR10()` function. The training and test sets are loaded into `DataLoader` objects, which are used to iterate over the data in batches during training and testing. However, I cannot find the batch size used for training and testing, the number of workers used for data loading, and the device used for training and testing (CPU or GPU).
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py. Done.
2. Run the training script to establish a baseline performance.
3. Identify potential areas for improvement.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters and training settings to improve performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script train.py and understood the model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, the training epochs, and the data loading process.
2. Guessed: I have not run the training script yet.
3. Guessed: I have not inspected the training script yet.
4. Guessed: I have not inspected the training script yet.
5. Guessed: I have not inspected the training script yet.
Thought:   I should run the training script to establish a baseline performance.
