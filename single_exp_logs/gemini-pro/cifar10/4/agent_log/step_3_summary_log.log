Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     I have inspected the training script again and identified a few potential areas for improvement. First, the model architecture is relatively simple and may not be able to capture the complexity of the CIFAR-10 dataset. Second, the training epochs are only 5, which may not be enough for the model to converge. Third, the learning rate of the optimizer is fixed at 0.1, which may not be optimal for the model.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py. Done.
2. Run the training script to establish a baseline performance. Done.
3. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters and training settings to improve performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script train.py and understood the model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, the training epochs, and the data loading process.
2. Directly confirmed: I have run the training script and observed the output.
3. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script again and identified a few potential areas for improvement.
4. Guessed: I have not experimented with different hyperparameters and training settings yet.
5. Guessed: I have not inspected the training script yet.
Thought:     I should experiment with different hyperparameters and training settings to improve performance.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model architecture is simple and may not be able to capture the complexity of the CIFAR-10 dataset. The training epochs are only 5, which may not be enough for the model to converge. The learning rate of the optimizer is fixed at 0.1, which may not be optimal for the model.
[Action]: Edited the training script train.py to increase the number of training epochs to 10, change the learning rate of the optimizer to 0.01, and add a dropout layer after the first fully connected layer. Saved the edited file as train_improved.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_improved.py. The diff shows that the number of training epochs is increased to 10, the learning rate of the optimizer is changed to 0.01, and a dropout layer is added after the first fully connected layer.
