Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The edited training script has been executed and the final training accuracy is 68.53% and the final test accuracy is 62.63%. This is an improvement over the baseline performance of 49.59% test accuracy.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py. Done.
2. Run the training script to establish a baseline performance. Done.
3. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters and training settings to improve performance. Done.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.





Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script train.py and understood the model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, the training epochs, and the data loading process.
2. Directly confirmed: I have run the training script and observed the output.
3. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script again and identified a few potential areas for improvement.
4. Directly confirmed: I have edited the training script to increase the number of training epochs, change the learning rate of the optimizer, and add a dropout layer.
5. Directly confirmed: I have executed the edited training script and observed the output.
Thought:   The goal of improving the test accuracy by more than 10% has been achieved. I should save the per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
