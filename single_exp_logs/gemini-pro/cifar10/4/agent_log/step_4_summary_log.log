Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edit is correct and desirable. The number of training epochs has been increased to 10, the learning rate of the optimizer has been changed to 0.01, and a dropout layer has been added after the first fully connected layer.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py. Done.
2. Run the training script to establish a baseline performance. Done.
3. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
4. Experiment with different hyperparameters and training settings to improve performance. In progress.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.



Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script train.py and understood the model architecture, the optimizer, the loss function, the training epochs, and the data loading process.
2. Directly confirmed: I have run the training script and observed the output.
3. Directly confirmed: I have inspected the training script again and identified a few potential areas for improvement.
4. Directly confirmed: I have edited the training script to increase the number of training epochs, change the learning rate of the optimizer, and add a dropout layer.
5. Guessed: I have not inspected the training script yet.
Thought:  I should run the edited training script to see if the performance improves.
Action:  Execute Script
