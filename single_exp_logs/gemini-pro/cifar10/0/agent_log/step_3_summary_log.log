===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The data augmentation transformations did not improve the model performance. The test accuracy is still around 41%.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Design experiments to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Run experiments and analyze the results. Done.
4. If the goal is not achieved, revise the plan and repeat steps 2 and 3.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The data augmentation transformations did not improve the model performance. The test accuracy is still around 41%.
Thought:    I should try a different approach to improve the model performance. One way to do this is to try different optimizers.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    {

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The data augmentation transformations did not improve the model performance, so a different approach is needed. One way to do this is to try different optimizers.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py to change the optimizer from SGD to Adam and set the learning rate to 0.001. The edited file was saved as train_adam.py.
[Observation]: The edited file train_adam.py was saved. The diff shows that the optimizer was changed from SGD to Adam and the learning rate was set to 0.001.
