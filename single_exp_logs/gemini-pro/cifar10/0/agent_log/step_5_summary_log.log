===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 improved the model performance. The test accuracy is now 57.17%, which is higher than the baseline accuracy of 41.51%.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Design experiments to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Run experiments and analyze the results. Done.
4. If the goal is not achieved, revise the plan and repeat steps 2 and 3.
5. Execute the edited script train_adam.py and analyze the results. Done.
6. If the goal is achieved, submit the final answer.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 improved the model performance. The test accuracy is now 57.17%, which is higher than the baseline accuracy of 41.51%.
Thought:  The goal is achieved. I should submit the final answer.
Action:  Final Answer
Action Input:  {
"final_answer": "The final answer is to use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. This improved the test accuracy from 41.51% to 57.17%."

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
