Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edit is correct and desirable. The Adam optimizer is a more powerful optimizer than SGD and the learning rate of 0.001 is a good starting point.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Design experiments to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Run experiments and analyze the results. Done.
4. If the goal is not achieved, revise the plan and repeat steps 2 and 3.
5. Execute the edited script train_adam.py and analyze the results.


Fact Check: 
1. Guessed: The Adam optimizer is a more powerful optimizer than SGD and the learning rate of 0.001 is a good starting point.
Thought:  I should execute the edited script train_adam.py and analyze the results.
Action:  Execute Script
Action Input: 
{
"script_name": "train_adam.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
