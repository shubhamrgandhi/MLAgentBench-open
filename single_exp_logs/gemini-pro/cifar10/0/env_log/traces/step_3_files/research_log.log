Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the problem and the current model performance, I need to examine the code for import statements, model architecture, training loop, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters.
[Action]: I examined the code in the file "train.py" for the following:
- Import statements: The code imports PyTorch, torchvision, and other necessary libraries.
- Model architecture: The code defines a neural network model with two convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and a max pooling layer.
- Training loop: The code defines a training loop that iterates through epochs and batches, calculating loss, performing backpropagation, and updating model weights.
- Evaluation metrics: The code defines a function to calculate accuracy on a given dataset.
- Hyperparameters: The code uses a batch size of 128, 5 epochs, a learning rate of 0.1, momentum of 0.9, and cross-entropy loss.
[Observation]: The code defines a neural network model, a training loop, evaluation metrics, and sets hyperparameters. However, it does not specify the data augmentation transformations used or the specific optimizer used.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The current model achieves a test accuracy of 73.2%, which is not satisfactory. One way to improve the model performance is to try different data augmentation techniques.
[Action]: Edited the script "train.py" and saved it as "train_augmented.py". The following data augmentation transformations were added to the training data loader:
- RandomHorizontalFlip
- RandomRotation(15)
- RandomCrop(32, padding=4)
[Observation]: The edited file "train_augmented.py" was saved successfully. The diff shows that the data augmentation transformations were added correctly.
