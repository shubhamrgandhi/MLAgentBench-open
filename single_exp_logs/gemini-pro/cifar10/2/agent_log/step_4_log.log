You are a helpful research assistant. You have access to the following tools:
- List Files:
        Use this to navigate the file system.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: List Files
        Action Input: {
            "dir_path": [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a list of files and folders in dir_path or current directory is dir_path is empty, or an error message if dir_path is invalid.]
        ```

- Copy File:
        Use this to copy a file to a new location with a new name.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Copy File
        Action Input: {
            "source": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],

        ```

- Edit Script (AI):
        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],

            "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Reflection
        Action Input: {
            "things_to_reflect_on": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]
        ```



Research Problem: Given a training script on a dataset train.py, improve upon the current model performance (trained with current hyperparmeters in train.py) for more than 10%. The training epochs should be within 10 to save time. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py. 

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.

Action Input:     {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What are some potential areas for improvement?"

Observation:
```
Reflection: 1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The agent could try tuning the hyperparameters of the model, such as the batch size, learning rate, momentum, and number of epochs, to improve the model performance. For example, the agent could try increasing the batch size to reduce the variance of the gradients and speed up the training process. The agent could also try increasing the number of epochs to allow the model to learn more from the training data.


2. **Model Architecture**: The agent could try modifying the architecture of the model to improve its performance. For example, the agent could try adding more convolutional layers or fully connected layers to the model to increase its capacity. The agent could also try using different activation functions or regularization techniques to improve the model's generalization performance.


3. **Data Augmentation**: The agent could try applying data augmentation techniques to the training data to improve the model's robustness and generalization performance. For example, the agent could try randomly cropping, rotating, or flipping the images in the training set to create new training examples. The agent could also try adding noise or occlusions to the images to make them more challenging for the model to learn.


4. **Ensemble Methods**: The agent could try using ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to improve the model's performance. For example, the agent could train multiple models with different hyperparameters or different subsets of the training data and then combine their predictions to make a final prediction. Ensemble methods can often achieve better performance than a single model by reducing the variance of the predictions.


5. **Transfer Learning**: The agent could try using transfer learning to improve the model's performance. For example, the agent could train a model on a large dataset of images and then fine-tune the model on the smaller dataset of images for the specific task at hand. Transfer learning can often help the model to learn faster and achieve better performance on the new task.
