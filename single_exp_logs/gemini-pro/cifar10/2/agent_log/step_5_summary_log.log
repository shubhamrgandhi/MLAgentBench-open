Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation shows that the edit to the train.py script was successful. The batch size was changed from 128 to 256.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements. In progress.
4. Save per class predictions for test set examples to submission.csv. Not started.




Fact Check:  
1. The current model performance is 96.73% test accuracy.
2. Potential areas for improvement have been identified.
3. Experiments have been designed and conducted.
4. Per class predictions have not been saved to submission.csv.
Thought:  I should now run the edited script to see if the model performance improves.
Action:  Execute Script
Action Input:  {
    "script_name": "train_batch_256.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the model performance. The batch size was changed from 128 to 256 in the train.py script. Running the edited script will show if the model performance improves.
[Action]: The train_batch_256.py script was executed.
[Observation]: The script ran successfully. The final train accuracy was 63.35% and the final test accuracy was 59.14%.
