Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation provides several potential areas for improvement, including hyperparameter tuning, model architecture, data augmentation, ensemble methods, and transfer learning.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements. In progress.
4. Save per class predictions for test set examples to submission.csv. Not started.


Fact Check: 
1. The current model performance is 96.73% test accuracy.
2. Potential areas for improvement have been identified.
3. Experiments have not been designed or conducted.
4. Per class predictions have not been saved to submission.csv.
Thought:  I should start by designing and conducting experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements. I can start by tuning the hyperparameters of the model.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The current model performance is 96.73% test accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning is one of the potential areas for improvement. Changing the batch size is a common hyperparameter tuning technique.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py to change the batch size from 128 to 256 and saved the edited file as train_batch_256.py.
[Observation]: The edited file train_batch_256.py is saved. The diff shows that the batch size is changed from 128 to 256 in the code.
