Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows that the model performance decreased after changing the batch size from 128 to 256. The final test accuracy is now 59.14%.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements. In progress.
4. Save per class predictions for test set examples to submission.csv. Not started.






Fact Check:   
1. The current model performance is 96.73% test accuracy.
2. Potential areas for improvement have been identified.
3. Experiments have been designed and conducted.
4. Per class predictions have not been saved to submission.csv.
Thought:   I should try a different hyperparameter setting.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model performance decreased after changing the batch size from 128 to 256. Trying a different hyperparameter setting may improve the performance.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py to change the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.01 and saved the edited file as train_lr_0.01.py.
[Observation]: The edited file train_lr_0.01.py is saved. The diff shows that the learning rate in the optimizer is changed from 0.1 to 0.01.
