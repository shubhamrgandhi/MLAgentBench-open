We are trying to solve this research problem: Given a training script on a dataset train.py, improve upon the current model performance (trained with current hyperparmeters in train.py) for more than 10%. The training epochs should be within 10 to save time. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and the current model performance by reading the train.py script.
[Action]: The agent attempts to read the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "cannot read file train.py".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is required to proceed with the research plan.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The train.py script was found in the current directory.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the current model performance to proceed with the research plan. The agent found the train.py script and decided to look for information about the model performance, hyperparameters, and training epochs in the script.
[Action]: The agent provided the train.py script as input to the Understand File action. The agent specified that it is looking for information about the model performance, hyperparameters, and training epochs.
[Observation]: The agent found the following information in the train.py script:
- Model Performance:
  - Train Accuracy: 99.03%
  - Test Accuracy: 96.73%
- Hyperparameters:
  - Batch Size: 128
  - Learning Rate: 0.1
  - Momentum: 0.9
  - Epochs: 5
- Training Epochs:
  - The model was trained for 5 epochs.
- Critical Lines in the Script:
  - Line 53: `batch_size = 128`
  - Line 54: `optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, momentum=0.9)`
  - Line 55: `epochs = 5`
  - Lines 60-80: The training loop
  - Lines 82-84: The evaluation loop
- The agent could not find information about the number of convolutional layers, the number of fully connected layers, and the number of neurons in each layer of the model.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the current model performance and identifying potential areas for improvement.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the current model performance and identifying potential areas for improvement.
[Observation]: The agent has identified five potential areas for improvement: hyperparameter tuning, model architecture, data augmentation, ensemble methods, and transfer learning.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The current model performance is 96.73% test accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning is one of the potential areas for improvement. Changing the batch size is a common hyperparameter tuning technique.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py to change the batch size from 128 to 256 and saved the edited file as train_batch_256.py.
[Observation]: The edited file train_batch_256.py is saved. The diff shows that the batch size is changed from 128 to 256 in the code.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the model performance. The batch size was changed from 128 to 256 in the train.py script. Running the edited script will show if the model performance improves.
[Action]: The train_batch_256.py script was executed.
[Observation]: The script ran successfully. The final train accuracy was 63.35% and the final test accuracy was 59.14%.


```
Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The current model performance is 96.73% test accuracy.
- Potential areas for improvement include hyperparameter tuning, model architecture, data augmentation, ensemble methods, and transfer learning.
- Changing the batch size from 128 to 256 resulted in a decrease in model performance (final test accuracy of 59.14%).
