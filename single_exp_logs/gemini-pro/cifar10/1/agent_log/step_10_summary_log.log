Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The inspect script lines action was successful. The lines from 21 to 30 of the script were displayed.
Research Plan and Status:         
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance:
    - Understand the training script train.py and the current model performance.
    - Understand the data set and the task.
    - Inspect the training script train.py and understand the current model architecture and hyperparameters.
    - Run the training script and observe the current model performance on the validation set.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement:
    - Inspect the training script train.py and identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
    - Research existing literature and identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
3. Design and conduct experiments to improve the model performance:
    - Design experiments to evaluate the impact of different model architectures and hyperparameters on the model performance.
    - Conduct experiments and observe the model performance on the validation set.
4. Finalize the model and evaluate on the test set:
    - Select the best model architecture and hyperparameters based on the experimental results.
    - Train the final model on the training set and evaluate the model performance on the test set.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv:
    - Modify the training script train.py to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.


















Fact Check:         
- The lines from 21 to 30 of the script were displayed. (directly confirmed)
Thought:         I can now inspect the training script train.py to understand the current model architecture and hyperparameters.
Action:         Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:         
```
{
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 31,
    "end_line_number": 40
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 109):

        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Set device for training
    device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

    # Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action is to inspect the lines 31 to 40 of the script train.py to understand the current model architecture and hyperparameters.
[Action]: The action is to inspect the lines 31 to 40 of the script train.py.
[Observation]: The observation is that the lines 31 to 40 of the script train.py are:

```
