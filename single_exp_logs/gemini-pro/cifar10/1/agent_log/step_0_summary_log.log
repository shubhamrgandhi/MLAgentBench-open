Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to understand the problem and come up with a plan.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance:
    - Understand the training script train.py and the current model performance.
    - Understand the data set and the task.
    - Inspect the training script train.py and understand the current model architecture and hyperparameters.
    - Run the training script and observe the current model performance on the validation set.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement:
    - Inspect the training script train.py and identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
    - Research existing literature and identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
3. Design and conduct experiments to improve the model performance:
    - Design experiments to evaluate the impact of different model architectures and hyperparameters on the model performance.
    - Conduct experiments and observe the model performance on the validation set.
4. Finalize the model and evaluate on the test set:
    - Select the best model architecture and hyperparameters based on the experimental results.
    - Train the final model on the training set and evaluate the model performance on the test set.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv:
    - Modify the training script train.py to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
