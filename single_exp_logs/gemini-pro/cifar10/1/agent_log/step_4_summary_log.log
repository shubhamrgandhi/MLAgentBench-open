===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    There is no existing literature in the current directory. I need to find other resources to identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance:
    - Understand the training script train.py and the current model performance.
    - Understand the data set and the task.
    - Inspect the training script train.py and understand the current model architecture and hyperparameters.
    - Run the training script and observe the current model performance on the validation set.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement:
    - Inspect the training script train.py and identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
    - Research existing literature and identify potential areas for improvement in the model architecture and hyperparameters.
3. Design and conduct experiments to improve the model performance:
    - Design experiments to evaluate the impact of different model architectures and hyperparameters on the model performance.
    - Conduct experiments and observe the model performance on the validation set.
4. Finalize the model and evaluate on the test set:
    - Select the best model architecture and hyperparameters based on the experimental results.
    - Train the final model on the training set and evaluate the model performance on the test set.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv:
    - Modify the training script train.py to save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.










Fact Check:     
- There is no existing literature in the current directory. (directly confirmed)
Thought:     I can use the internet to search for existing literature on improving the performance of CNNs for image classification.
Action:     Undo Edit Script
Action Input:     
```
{
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: There is no change to undo.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The user wants to undo the edit script for the file train.py, but there is no change to undo.
[Action]: The user attempts to undo the edit script for the file train.py.
[Observation]: The system responds with an error message indicating that there is no change to undo.
