Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the problem and the training script, I need to examine the training script and identify key details such as the model architecture, optimizer, learning rate, number of epochs, data augmentation techniques, and evaluation metrics.
[Action]: I examined the training script named "train.py" and identified the following details:
- Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and a final output layer.
- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9.
- Learning Rate: 0.1.
- Number of Epochs: 5.
- Data Augmentation Techniques: Random cropping, random horizontal flipping, random rotation, and color jitter.
- Evaluation Metrics: Training accuracy and test accuracy.
[Observation]: The training script uses a CNN model with SGD optimizer and a learning rate of 0.1. It trains the model for 5 epochs and employs data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance. The model is evaluated using training accuracy and test accuracy metrics.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to inspect the script lines to understand how the training loss is calculated and printed.
[Action]: The action is to inspect lines 83 to 89 of the script named "train.py".
[Observation]: The code snippet calculates the running loss by adding the loss of each mini-batch to the running loss. It then prints the average running loss every 2000 mini-batches. After all mini-batches are processed, it calculates the training and test accuracy by calling the `test_model` function with the respective dataloaders.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: I executed the script to see the training and test accuracy.
[Action]: I executed the script "train.py".
[Observation]: The training and test accuracy are printed every 2000 mini-batches. The final training and test accuracy are also printed after all epochs are completed. The final training accuracy is 58.15% and the final test accuracy is 54.22%.
