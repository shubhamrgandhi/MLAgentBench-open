Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. It increases the number of epochs to 10.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. In progress.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.








Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The edit is correct and desirable.
2. Directly confirmed: It increases the number of epochs to 10.
Thought:    I can now execute the edited script to see if the performance of the model improves.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    
```
{
  "script_name": "train_10_epochs.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
