===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit script action failed because there is no change to undo. This means that the previous edit script action was not successful.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. Not started.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.










Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The edit script action failed.
2. Directly confirmed: There is no change to undo.
Thought:     I need to figure out why the edit script action failed. I can try to inspect the script lines to see if the edit was made correctly.
Action:     Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:     
```
{
  "script_name": "train_10_epochs.py",
  "start_line_number": 65,
  "end_line_number": 66
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 107):

        return 100 * correct / total

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
