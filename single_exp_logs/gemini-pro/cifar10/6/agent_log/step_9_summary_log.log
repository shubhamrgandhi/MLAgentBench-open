Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The training script was executed successfully. The model was trained for 10 epochs and the final training accuracy was 50.11% and the final testing accuracy was 45.44%. This is not an improvement over the baseline performance of the model trained for 5 epochs.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. Not started.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.








Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The training script was executed successfully.
2. Directly confirmed: The model was trained for 10 epochs.
3. Directly confirmed: The final training accuracy was 50.11%.
4. Directly confirmed: The final testing accuracy was 45.44%.
5. Directly confirmed: This is not an improvement over the baseline performance of the model trained for 5 epochs.
Thought:      I need to try a different approach to improve the performance of the model. I can try using a different optimizer or a different learning rate.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model trained for 10 epochs did not show improvement over the baseline model trained for 5 epochs. Changing the optimizer and learning rate may improve the performance of the model.
[Action]: Edited the training script to change the optimizer from SGD to Adam and the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.01.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_10_epochs.py. The diff shows that the optimizer and learning rate were changed as instructed.
