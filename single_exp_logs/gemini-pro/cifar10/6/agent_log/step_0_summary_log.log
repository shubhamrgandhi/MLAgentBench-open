- The convolutional layers use a kernel size of 5 and a stride of 1.
- The fully connected layers have 120 and 84 neurons, respectively.
- The output layer has 10 neurons, corresponding to the 10 classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Optimizer:**

- The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9.

**Learning Rate:**

- The learning rate is set to 0.1.

**Number of Epochs:**

- The model is trained for 5 epochs.

**Data Augmentation Techniques:**

- The data augmentation techniques used are:
  - Random cropping
  - Random horizontal flipping
  - Random rotation
  - Color jitter

**Evaluation Metrics:**

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To understand the problem and the training script, I need to examine the training script and identify key details such as the model architecture, optimizer, learning rate, number of epochs, data augmentation techniques, and evaluation metrics.
[Action]: I examined the training script named "train.py" and identified the following details:
- Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with three convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and a final output layer.
- Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9.
- Learning Rate: 0.1.
- Number of Epochs: 5.
- Data Augmentation Techniques: Random cropping, random horizontal flipping, random rotation, and color jitter.
- Evaluation Metrics: Training accuracy and test accuracy.
[Observation]: The training script uses a CNN model with SGD optimizer and a learning rate of 0.1. It trains the model for 5 epochs and employs data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance. The model is evaluated using training accuracy and test accuracy metrics.
