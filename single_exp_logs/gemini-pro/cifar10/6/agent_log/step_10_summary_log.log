Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The edit script action was successful. The optimizer was changed from SGD to Adam and the learning rate was changed from 0.1 to 0.01 in the script.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. Not started.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.










Fact Check:       
1. Directly confirmed: The edit script action was successful.
2. Directly confirmed: The optimizer was changed from SGD to Adam in the script.
3. Directly confirmed: The learning rate was changed from 0.1 to 0.01 in the script.
Thought:       I can now run the training script again with the new optimizer and learning rate and see if the performance of the model improves.
Action:       Execute Script
Action Input:       
```
{
  "script_name": "train_10_epochs.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The edit script action was successful and the optimizer and learning rate were changed in the script. Running the script again with the new optimizer and learning rate can help evaluate if the performance of the model improves.
[Action]: Executed the script "train_10_epochs.py".
[Observation]: The script ran successfully and the output shows the training and testing accuracy for each epoch. The final training accuracy is 53.94% and the final testing accuracy is 50.27%.
