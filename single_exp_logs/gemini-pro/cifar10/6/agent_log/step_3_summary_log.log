===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The training accuracy is 58.15% and the test accuracy is 54.22%. This means that there is room for improvement.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. In progress.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. Not started.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.








Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The training accuracy is 58.15%.
2. Directly confirmed: The test accuracy is 54.22%.
Thought:    I can try to improve the performance of the model by increasing the number of epochs. I can also try to improve the data augmentation techniques.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    
```
{
  "script_name": "train.py",
  "edit_instruction": "Increase the number of epochs to 10.",

        The edited file is saved to train_10_epochs.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: Increasing the number of epochs can potentially improve the performance of the model by allowing it to learn more from the training data.
[Action]: Edited the training script (train.py) to increase the number of epochs from 5 to 10. The edited script was saved as train_10_epochs.py.
[Observation]: The edited file train_10_epochs.py was saved successfully. The diff shows that the number of epochs was changed from 5 to 10 in the training loop.
