===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The training accuracy is 54.82% and the test accuracy is 50.77%. This means that increasing the number of epochs from 5 to 10 did not improve the performance of the model.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. Not started.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.










Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The training accuracy is 54.82%.
2. Directly confirmed: The test accuracy is 50.77%.
Thought:     I need to try other methods to improve the performance of the model. I can try to improve the data augmentation techniques or try a different optimizer.
Action:     Undo Edit Script
Action Input:     
```
{
  "script_name": "train_10_epochs.py"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: There is no change to undo.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The training script did not improve the performance of the model, so I need to try other methods to improve the performance of the model.
[Action]: Undo the edit script named "train_10_epochs.py".
[Observation]: The environment reported an error message "EnvError: There is no change to undo."
