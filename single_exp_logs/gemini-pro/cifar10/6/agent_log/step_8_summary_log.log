Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The edit script action was successful. The number of epochs was changed from 5 to 10 in the script.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the training script. Done.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement. Done.
3. Design and conduct experiments to evaluate the improvements. Not started.
4. Submit the final answer. Not started.












Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The edit script action was successful.
2. Directly confirmed: The number of epochs was changed from 5 to 10 in the script.
Thought:      I can now run the training script again with the new number of epochs and see if the performance of the model improves.
Action:      Execute Script
Action Input:      
```
{
  "script_name": "train_10_epochs.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
