===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The model performance has not improved significantly after adding data augmentation and early stopping. The final training accuracy is 51.28% and the final test accuracy is 50.76%. This is still below the goal of 60% accuracy.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Design experiments to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Run experiments and analyze results. Done.
4. If the goal is not achieved, revise the plan and repeat steps 2 and 3. In progress.

5. Implement the best method and evaluate the model performance. In progress.

6. Save the predictions to submission.csv. Not started.





Fact Check:  
1. This is a confirmed statement.
Thought:   I should try a different model architecture or hyperparameters to see if I can improve the performance.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:  
{
"script_name": "train_cnn.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The environment has shut down because the maximum number of steps or time has been reached. Please submit your final answer.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
