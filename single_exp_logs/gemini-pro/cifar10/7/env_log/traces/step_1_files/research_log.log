Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the current model performance.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "train.py" to find the dataset, the model architecture, the training hyperparameters, and the current model performance.
[Observation]: The agent finds the dataset, the model architecture, the training hyperparameters, and the current model performance. However, the agent cannot find the number of workers used for data loading, the dropout rate, and the weight decay.
