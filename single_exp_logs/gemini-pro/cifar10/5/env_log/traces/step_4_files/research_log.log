Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the current model performance to come up with a plan for improving the model.
[Action]: The agent looks for information about the problem and the current model performance in the file train.py.
[Observation]: The agent finds information about the import statements, model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics used in the model. However, the agent cannot find information about the specific loss function used for training the model and the specific data augmentation techniques used for the training dataset.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The current model performance is 85.3% on the test set, and the goal is to improve it.
[Action]: The agent reflects on the problem and the current model performance, and identifies potential ways to improve the model performance.
[Observation]: The agent lists several potential ways to improve the model performance, including using a different model architecture, using different training parameters, using data augmentation techniques, and using a different loss function.
