Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  Experiment 1 shows that the model with the different model architecture performs worse than the current model. The accuracy of the model with the different model architecture is only 8.94% on the test set, while the accuracy of the current model is 50.21% on the test set.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential ways to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the potential improvements. In progress.
4. Implement the improvements and evaluate the model performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.








Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: Experiment 1 shows that the model with the different model architecture performs worse than the current model.
Thought:   I need to try other potential improvements to the model. I can try using different training parameters, data augmentation techniques, or a different loss function.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:  
{
 "things_to_reflect_on": "What other potential improvements can I try to the model?"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: There are several other potential improvements that can be tried to the model to improve its performance. One potential improvement is to use different training parameters. For example, the learning rate, the batch size, and the number of epochs can all be adjusted to see if they can improve the model's performance. Another potential improvement is to use data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques can help to increase the size of the training dataset and make the model more robust to noise and overfitting. Additionally, a different loss function can be used. The loss function is used to measure the error of the model's predictions, and different loss functions can lead to different model behaviors. Finally, a different model architecture can be used. There are many different model architectures available, and some may be better suited to the task at hand than others.
