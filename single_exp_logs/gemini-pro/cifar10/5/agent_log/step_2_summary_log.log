Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have identified several potential ways to improve the model performance. I need to design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these potential improvements.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential ways to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the potential improvements. In progress.
4. Implement the improvements and evaluate the model performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: I have identified several potential ways to improve the model performance.
Thought:    I can design the following experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the potential improvements:
- Experiment 1: Compare the performance of the current model with a model that uses a different model architecture.
- Experiment 2: Compare the performance of the current model with a model that uses different training parameters.
- Experiment 3: Compare the performance of the current model with a model that uses data augmentation techniques.
- Experiment 4: Compare the performance of the current model with a model that uses a different loss function.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The AI assistant identified several potential ways to improve the model performance and needs to design experiments to evaluate their effectiveness. The first experiment is to compare the performance of the current model with a model that uses a different model architecture.
[Action]: The AI assistant edited the script train.py to implement Experiment 1. It added dropout layers to the model, trained the model with dropout, and evaluated the model's performance on the training and test datasets.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_experiment_1.py. The diff shows the changes made to the script. The model's performance on the training and test datasets is printed after training.
