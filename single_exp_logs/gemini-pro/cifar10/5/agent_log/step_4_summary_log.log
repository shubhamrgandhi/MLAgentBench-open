Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     Experiment 1 shows that the model with the different model architecture performs worse than the current model. The accuracy of the model with the different model architecture is only 8.94% on the test set, while the accuracy of the current model is 50.21% on the test set.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential ways to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the potential improvements. In progress.
4. Implement the improvements and evaluate the model performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: Experiment 1 shows that the model with the different model architecture performs worse than the current model.
Thought:     I need to try other potential improvements to the model. I can try using different training parameters, data augmentation techniques, or a different loss function.
Action:     Reflection
Action Input:     {
 "things_to_reflect_on": "What other potential improvements can I try to the model?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: There are several other potential improvements that can be tried to the model to improve its performance:

* **Use different training parameters:** The training parameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, can have a significant impact on the model's performance. Experimenting with different values of these parameters can help to find a set of parameters that results in better performance.
* **Use data augmentation techniques:** Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation, can help to improve the model's performance by increasing the amount of data that the model is trained on. This can help to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.
* **Use a different loss function:** The loss function is used to measure the error of the model's predictions. Different loss functions can lead to different model performance. Experimenting with different loss functions can help to find a loss function that results in better performance.
* **Use a different model architecture:** The model architecture is the structure of the model. Different model architectures can have different performance characteristics. Experimenting with different model architectures can help to find an architecture that results in better performance.
* **Use a pre-trained model:** A pre-trained model is a model that has been trained on a large dataset. This can help to improve the performance of the model on a new dataset, even if the new dataset is small.
