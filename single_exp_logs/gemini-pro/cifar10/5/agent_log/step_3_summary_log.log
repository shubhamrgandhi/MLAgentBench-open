Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. The code now implements Experiment 1, which compares the performance of the current model with a model that uses a different model architecture.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential ways to improve the model performance. Done.
3. Design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the potential improvements. In progress.
4. Implement the improvements and evaluate the model performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The edit is correct and desirable.
Thought:    I can now run Experiment 1 and see if the model with the different model architecture performs better than the current model.

[Action]: Executed the script "train_experiment_1.py" to compare the performance of the current model with a model that uses a different model architechture.
[Observation]: The script has been successfully run. The training and test accuracy for both models have been recorded. The current model achieved a training accuracy of 54.16% and a test accuracy of 50.21%, while the model with the different model architechture achieved a training accuracy of 8.76% and a test accuracy of 8.94%.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The edit to the code was correct and desirable, as it implemented Experiment 1, which compares the performance of the current model with a model that uses a different model architecture.
[Action]: The script "train_experiement_1.py" was executed.
[Obersvation]: The script ran successfully and trained two models: the current model and a model with a different model architecture. The accuracy of the current model was 54.16% on the training set and 50.21% on the test set. The accuracy of the model with the different model architecture was 8.76% on the training set and 8.94% on the test set.
