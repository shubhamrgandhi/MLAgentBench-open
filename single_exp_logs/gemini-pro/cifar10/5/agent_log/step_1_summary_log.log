Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the problem and the current model performance. The current model achieves an accuracy of 85.3% on the test set. I need to identify potential ways to improve the model performance.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the current model performance. Done.
2. Identify potential ways to improve the model performance. In progress.
3. Design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the potential improvements.
4. Implement the improvements and evaluate the model performance.
5. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: The current model achieves an accuracy of 85.3% on the test set.
Thought:   I can try the following to improve the model performance:
- Use a different model architecture.
- Use different training parameters.
- Use data augmentation techniques.
- Use a different loss function.
Action:   Reflection

        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: To improve the model performance, you can try the following:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and regularization parameters. You can use automated hyperparameter tuning tools or manually adjust the hyperparameters based on your knowledge of the model and the dataset.

2. **Data Augmentation:** Apply data augmentation techniques to the training dataset to increase the diversity of the data and reduce overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques include random cropping, flipping, rotation, and color jittering.

3. **Model Architecture:** Consider modifying the model architecture to improve its performance. This could involve adding or removing layers, changing the activation functions, or experimenting with different types of layers.

4. **Loss Function:** Explore different loss functions that are suitable for the task at hand. For example, if the task is image classification, you could try using a cross-entropy loss function or a hinge loss function.

5. **Regularization Techniques:** Apply regularization techniques to the model to reduce overfitting. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and data augmentation.

6. **Ensemble Methods:** Train multiple models with different hyperparameters or architectures and combine their predictions to improve the overall performance. This can be done through methods such as bagging, boosting, or stacking.

7. **Transfer Learning:** If there is a pre-trained model that is relevant to your task, you can use transfer learning to initialize the weights of your model. This can help the model to learn faster and achieve better performance.

8. **Early Stopping:** Implement early stopping to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training process when the performance starts to degrade.
