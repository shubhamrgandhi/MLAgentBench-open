Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To understand the problem and the training script train.py, the first step is to understand the file.
[Action]: Understand the file train.py by looking for the overall structure of the script, the model architecture, the loss function, the optimizer, the training loop, and the evaluation loop.
[Observation]: The overall structure of the script is as follows:
- Import necessary libraries.
- Define data augmentation transforms.
- Define the CNN model architecture.
- Define the loss function and optimizer.
- Define the training and evaluation loops.
- Train the model.
- Evaluate the model on the training and test sets.
- Save the model predictions to a CSV file.
The model architecture consists of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, flatten layer, and fully connected layers. The loss function is the cross-entropy loss. The optimizer is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.1 and a momentum of 0.9. The training loop iterates over the training data in batches, trains the model on each batch, calculates and backpropagates the loss, and updates the model parameters using the optimizer. The evaluation loop iterates over the test data in batches, evaluates the model on each batch, and calculates the accuracy.
