Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The error in the training script train_tuned.py is caused by the fact that the model Net() is not an object that can be used with GridSearchCV. This is because Net() is a custom model class that does not implement the 'fit' method, which is required by GridSearchCV.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py.
2. Run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance. Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set.
3. Research on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and select a few to try. I have researched on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and some of the common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. I have selected grid search and random search as the hyperparameter tuning techniques to try.
4. Tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model. The training script train.py has been edited and saved as train_tuned.py to include code for grid search and random search hyperparameter tuning.
5. Evaluate the performance of the tuned model. The training script train_tuned.py failed to run due to an error: "The 'estimator' parameter of GridSearchCV must be an object implementing 'fit'. Got Net(...) instead."
6. If the performance is not satisfactory, repeat steps 3-5.
7. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.










Fact Check:    
- Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set. (Confirmed)
Thought:    I should modify the training script train_tuned.py to use a model that implements the 'fit' method, such as the built-in PyTorch model.

[Reasoning]: The error in the training script train_tuned.py is caused by the fact that the model Net() is not an object that can be used with GridSearchCV. This is because Net() is a custom model class that does not implement the 'fit' method, which is required by GridSearchCV. To fix this error, the training script needs to be modified to use a model that implements the 'fit' method, such as the built-in PyTorch model.

[Action]: Edited the training script train_tuned.py to use a model that implements the 'fit' method, such as the built-in PyTorch model. The edited file is saved to train_tuned_modified.py.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_tuned_modified.py. The diff shows that the model Net() is replaced with the built-in PyTorch model.
