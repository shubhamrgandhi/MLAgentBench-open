Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The training script train_tuned_modified.py failed to run due to an error: "The 'estimator' parameter of GridSearchCV must be an object implementing 'fit'. Got Net(...) instead." This error is the same as the error that occurred when running the training script train_tuned.py. This indicates that the issue is not with the model, but with the way the hyperparameter tuning is being performed.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py.
2. Run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance. Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set.
3. Research on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and select a few to try. I have researched on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and some of the common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. I have selected grid search and random search as the hyperparameter tuning techniques to try.
4. Tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model. The training script train.py has been edited and saved as train_tuned.py to include code for grid search and random search hyperparameter tuning. The training script train_tuned.py failed to run due to an error: "The 'estimator' parameter of GridSearchCV must be an object implementing 'fit'. Got Net(...) instead." The training script train_tuned.py has been edited and saved as train_tuned_modified.py to use a model that implements the 'fit' method, such as the built-in PyTorch model. The training script train_tuned_modified.py failed to run due to the same error.
5. Evaluate the performance of the tuned model.
6. If the performance is not satisfactory, repeat steps 3-5.
7. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.












Fact Check:     
- Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set. (Confirmed)
Thought:     I should investigate the issue with the hyperparameter tuning code.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error message "The 'estimator' parameter of GridSearchCV must be an object implementing 'fit'. Got Net(...) instead." indicates that the model being used in the hyperparameter tuning code does not implement the 'fit' method.
[Action]: Inspected lines 79-81 of the training script train_tuned_modified.py.
[Observation]: The code in lines 79-81 attempts to fit the grid search object to the training dataset using the 'fit' method. However, the model being used, Net(...), does not implement the 'fit' method.
