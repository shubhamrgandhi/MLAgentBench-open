Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The training script train_tuned.py has been edited and saved as train_tuned_modified.py to use a model that implements the 'fit' method, such as the built-in PyTorch model.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py.
2. Run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance. Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set.
3. Research on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and select a few to try. I have researched on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and some of the common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. I have selected grid search and random search as the hyperparameter tuning techniques to try.
4. Tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model. The training script train.py has been edited and saved as train_tuned.py to include code for grid search and random search hyperparameter tuning. The training script train_tuned.py failed to run due to an error: "The 'estimator' parameter of GridSearchCV must be an object implementing 'fit'. Got Net(...) instead." The training script train_tuned.py has been edited and saved as train_tuned_modified.py to use a model that implements the 'fit' method, such as the built-in PyTorch model.
5. Evaluate the performance of the tuned model.
6. If the performance is not satisfactory, repeat steps 3-5.
7. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.










Fact Check:    
- Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set. (Confirmed)
Thought:    I should run the training script train_tuned_modified.py to evaluate the performance of the tuned model.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train_tuned_modified.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
