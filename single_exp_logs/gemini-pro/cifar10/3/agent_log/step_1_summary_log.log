Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the overall structure of the script, the model architecture, the loss function, the optimizer, the training loop, and the evaluation loop. However, I cannot find the number of epochs used for training, the batch size used for training and evaluation, and the device used for training and evaluation (CPU or GPU).
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py.
2. Run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance.
3. Research on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and select a few to try.
4. Tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model.
5. Evaluate the performance of the tuned model.
6. If the performance is not satisfactory, repeat steps 3-5.
7. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.




Fact Check:   No objective statements in this update.
Thought:   I should run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To get a baseline performance of the model, the training script was executed with the current hyperparameters.

[Action]: The training script train.py was executed.

[Observation]: The script was executed successfully. The training and evaluation accuracy of the model was printed during the training process. The final training accuracy was 56.45% and the final test accuracy was 52.74%.
