        Reflection:  I have researched on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and some of the common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py.
2. Run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance. Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set.
3. Research on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and select a few to try. I have researched on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and some of the common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms.
4. Tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model.
5. Evaluate the performance of the tuned model.
6. If the performance is not satisfactory, repeat steps 3-5.
7. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.

        Reflection: To improve the model performance, you can try different hyperparameter tuning techniques. Some common techniques include:

* **Grid search:** This is a simple but effective technique that involves trying out all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range. The best combination of hyperparameters is the one that produces the best performance on a validation set.
* **Random search:** This technique is similar to grid search, but instead of trying out all possible combinations of hyperparameters, it randomly samples a subset of the possible combinations. This can be more efficient than grid search, especially when there are a large number of hyperparameters to tune.
* **Bayesian optimization:** This technique uses a Bayesian model to estimate the relationship between the hyperparameters and the performance of the model. The model is then used to select the next combination of hyperparameters to try. This can be more efficient than grid search or random search, especially when there are a large number of hyperparameters to tune.
* **Evolutionary algorithms:** These techniques are inspired by the process of natural selection. A population of candidate solutions (hyperparameter combinations) is generated and evaluated. The best solutions are then selected and used to create new solutions. This process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found.

The best hyperparameter tuning technique for your problem will depend on the specific model and dataset that you are using. You may need to experiment with different techniques to find the one that works best.

Here are some additional tips for hyperparameter tuning:

* Start with a small number of hyperparameters. This will make the tuning process more manageable and will help you to avoid overfitting.
* Use a validation set to evaluate the performance of your model. This will help you to avoid overfitting and will allow you to select the best combination of hyperparameters.
* Be patient. Hyperparameter tuning can be a time-consuming process. However, it is important to be patient and to experiment with different techniques until you find the one that works best for your problem.

[Observation]: To improve the model performance, you can try different hypertuning techniques. Some common techniques include:
* **Grid search:** This is a simple but effective technique that involved trying out all possible combination of hyper-paramters within a specified range. The best combination of hyper-paramters is the one that produced the best performance on a valid set.
* **Random search:** This technique is similar to grid search, but instead of trying out all possible combination of hyper-paramters, it randomly samples a subset of the possible combination. This can be more efficient than grid search, especially when there are a large number of hyper-paramters to turn.
* **Bayesian Optimization:** This technique uses a Bayesian model to estimate the relationship between the hyper-paramters and the performance of the model. The model is then used to select the next combination of hyper-paramters to try. This can be more efficient than grid search or random search, especially when there are a large number of hyper-paramters to turn.
* **Evolutionary algorithm:** These techniques are inspired by the process of natural selection. A population of candidated solutions (hyper-paramter combination) is generated and evolved. The best solutions are then selected and used to create new solutions. This process is repeated until a satisfiable solution is found.
