Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have selected grid search and random search as the hyperparameter tuning techniques to try.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the training script train.py.
2. Run the training script with current hyperparameters to get a baseline performance. Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set.
3. Research on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and select a few to try. I have researched on common hyperparameter tuning techniques and some of the common techniques include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms. I have selected grid search and random search as the hyperparameter tuning techniques to try.
4. Tune the hyperparameters and retrain the model.
5. Evaluate the performance of the tuned model.
6. If the performance is not satisfactory, repeat steps 3-5.
7. Save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv as shown in train.py.






Fact Check:  
- Baseline performance is 52.74% accuracy on the test set. (Confirmed)
Thought:   I should tune the hyperparameters using grid search and random search and retrain the model.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add code to tune the hyperparameters using grid search and random search and retrain the model.",

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The goal is to tune the hyperparameters of the model using grid search and random search to improve the performance of the model.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py and saved it as train_tuned.py. The edited script includes code to perform grid search and random search for hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameters tuned are learning rate, momentum, and batch size. The best hyperparameters from grid search are then used to retrain the model.
[Observation]: The edited file train_tuned.py is saved. The diff shows the changes made to the script. The grid search and random search hyperparameter tuning code is added. The model is retrained with the best hyperparameters from grid search.
