===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edit script action was successful in vectorising the computation in the train.py script.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the train.py script to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Completed.
2. Edit the script to vectorise the computation. Completed.
3. Execute the script to see the new execution speed. In progress.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Pending.




Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. Guessed: I have not executed the script yet.
4. Guessed: I have not executed the script yet.
Thought:  I should now execute the script to see the new execution speed.
Action:  Execute Script
Action Input: 
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorized.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to vectorise the computation, and the next step is to execute the script to see the new execution speed.
[Action]: Execute the script "train_vectorized.py".
[Observation]: The script has been executed, and the output has been provided.
