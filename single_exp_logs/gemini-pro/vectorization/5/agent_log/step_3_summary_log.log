Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The execution of the train_vectorized.py script was successful.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Completed.
2. Edit the script to vectorise the computation. Completed.
3. Execute the script to see the new execution speed. Completed.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. In progress.






Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
3. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
4. Guessed: I have not stored the run time in the submission.csv file yet.
Thought:   I should now store the run time in the submission.csv file as shown in train.py.
Action:   List Files
Action Input:

    "dir_path": "."

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
