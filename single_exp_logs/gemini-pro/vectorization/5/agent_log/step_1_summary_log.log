Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the train.py script and found all possible ways where computation can be vectorised.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Completed.
2. Edit the script to vectorise the computation. In progress.
3. Execute the script to see the new execution speed. Pending.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Pending.




Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed: I have not edited the script yet.
3. Guessed: I have not executed the script yet.
4. Guessed: I have not executed the script yet.
Thought:   I should now edit the script to vectorise the computation.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script train.py contains computation that can be vectorized to improve execution speed.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to vectorize the computation in the following lines:
1. Line 10: The `relu` function was vectorized using numpy's `where` function.
2. Line 22: The `add_padding` function was vectorized using numpy's `pad` function.
3. Line 43: The `convolution_step` function was vectorized using numpy's `tensordot` function.
4. Line 66: The `forward` function was vectorized using numpy's `einsum` function.
