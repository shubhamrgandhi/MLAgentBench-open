Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the train.py script to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised.
[Action]: The agent looked for all possible ways where computation can be vectorised in the train.py script.
[Observation]: The agent found four vectorization opportunities in the train.py script:
1. The relu function can be vectorized using numpy's where function.
2. The add_padding function can be vectorized using numpy's pad function.
3. The convolution_step function can be vectorized using numpy's tensordot function.
4. The forward function can be vectorized using numpy's einsum function.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The script train.py contains computation that can be vectorized to improve execution speed.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to vectorize the computation in the following lines:
1. Line 10: The `relu` function was vectorized using numpy's `where` function.
2. Line 22: The `add_padding` function was vectorized using numpy's `pad` function.
3. Line 43: The `convolution_step` function was vectorized using numpy's `tensordot` function.
4. Line 66: The `forward` function was vectorized using numpy's `einsum` function.
The edited file was saved as train_vectorized.py.
[Observation]: The edited file train_vectorized.py was saved successfully. The diff of the edited file was provided for review.
