Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the execution speed of the train.py script. To do this, the first step is to understand the script and identify the parts that can be vectorised.
[Action]: Understand the train.py script.
[Observation]: The script defines several functions and classes for performing convolutional neural network (CNN) operations, but it does not contain a function that trains the model. The convolution operation in the `convolution_step` function and the forward pass in the `forward` function can be vectorised.
