===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Given a script train.py, execute it to see the current execution speed and then try to improve it with using only the numpy library and vectorisation in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123. Understand the train.py script well to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the execution speed of the train.py script. To do this, the first step is to understand the script and identify the parts that can be vectorised.
[Action]: Understand the train.py script.
[Observation]: The script defines several functions and classes for performing convolutional neural network (CNN) operations, but it does not contain a function that trains the model. The convolution operation in the `convolution_step` function and the forward pass in the `forward` function can be vectorised.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script does not contain a function that trains the model, so other ways to improve the execution speed need to be explored.
[Action]: Reflect on the question: "Are there any other ways to improve the execution speed of the script?"
[Observation]: There are several other ways to improve the execution speed of the script, including using a GPU, using a more efficient deep learning framework, using a pre-trained model, reducing the batch size, using data augmentation, and using early stopping.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The script is slow to execute. Vectorization can be used to improve the execution speed.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py to implement vectorization techniques. The edited file is saved as train_vectorized.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_vectorized.py. The diff shows the changes made to the script.
