Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script train_vectorised.py ran successfully without errors. I can now compare the execution speed with the original script train.py to see if there is any improvement.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done
2. Vectorise the forward function. Done
3. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved. In progress
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Not started







Fact Check:   
1. I have completed step 3, which is confirmed by the observation from the Execute Script action.
Thought:    I should compare the execution speed of the original script train.py with the vectorised script train_vectorised.py.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:   
```
{
"script_name": "train.py"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Time taken for execution: 2.693993330001831 s

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: I want to compare the execution speed of the original script train.py with the vectorised script train_vectorised.py.
[Action]: I executed the script train.py.
[Observation]: The script train.py has been executed and the execution time is 2.693993330001831 seconds.
