Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit to vectorise the `relu` function was successful. I can now proceed to vectorise the other functions.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done
2. Vectorise the forward function. In progress
3. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved. Not started
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Not started






Fact Check:   
1. I have completed step 2, which is confirmed by the observation from the Edit Script (AI) action.
Thought:    I should continue vectorising the other functions.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    {
"script_name": "train_vectorised.py",
"edit_instruction": "Vectorise the `add_padding` function using numpy's `pad` function.",

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The `add_padding` function can be vectorised using numpy's `pad` function, which can potentially improve the execution speed of the script.
[Action]: Edited the `train_vectorised.py` script to vectorise the `add_padding` function using numpy's `pad` function.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved as `train_vectorised.py`. The diff shows that the `add_padding` function has been modified to use numpy's `pad` function for padding.
