===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The original script train.py took 2.693993330001831 seconds to execute. I can now compare this with the execution time of the vectorised script train_vectorised.py to see if there is any improvement.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done
2. Vectorise the forward function. Done
3. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved. Done
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Not started









Fact Check:    
1. I have completed step 3, which is confirmed by the observation from the Execute Script action.
Thought:     I should store the run time of the vectorised script train_vectorised.py in a submission.csv file as shown in train.py.
Action:     Copy File
Action Input:    
```
{
"source": "train_vectorised.py",
"destination": "submission.csv"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        File train_vectorised.py copied to submission.csv
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The goal is to store the run time of the vectorised script train_vectorised.py in a submission.csv file as shown in train.py.

[Action]: The script train_vectorised.py was copied to submission.csv.

[Observation]: The observation confirms that the file train_vectorised.py was copied to submission.csv.
