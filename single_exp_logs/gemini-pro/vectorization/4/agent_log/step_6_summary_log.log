===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The script failed to run due to a syntax error. I need to debug the script to find the error.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done
2. Vectorise the forward function. Done
3. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved. In progress
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Not started





Fact Check:  
1. I have completed step 3, which is confirmed by the observation from the Execute Script action.
Thought:   I should debug the script to find the error.
Action:   Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:  
```
{
"script_name": "train_vectorised.py",
"start_line_number": 100,
"end_line_number": 110
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 103):

        output = np.einsum('bijk,ijkl->bijl', padded_batch, self.kernel_matrices) + self.biases

        if self.activation == 'relu':
            output = relu(
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script failed to run due to a syntax error. The error might be in the lines 100 to 110 of the script.
[Action]: Inspected lines 100 to 110 of the script train_vectorised.py.
[Observation]: The script ends at line 103. The lines 100 to 103 are:

```
output = np.einsum('bijk,ijkl->bijl', padded_batch, self.kernel_matrices) + self.biases

if self.activation == 'relu':
    output = relu(
