Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the train.py script and identified all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. I can now proceed to vectorise the forward function.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done
2. Vectorise the forward function. In progress
3. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved. Not started
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Not started




Fact Check:  
1. I have completed step 1, which is confirmed by the observation from the Understand File action.
Thought:   I should start by vectorising the `relu` function.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
"script_name": "train.py",
"edit_instruction": "Vectorise the `relu` function using numpy's `where` function.",
"save_name": "train_vectorised.py"
}

        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The `relu` function is a simple activation function that can be easily vectorised using numpy's `where` function.
[Action]: Edited the `train.py` script to vectorise the `relu` function using numpy's `where` function. Saved the edited script as `train_vectorised.py`.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train_vectorised.py`. The diff shows that the `relu` function has been vectorised using numpy's `where` function.
