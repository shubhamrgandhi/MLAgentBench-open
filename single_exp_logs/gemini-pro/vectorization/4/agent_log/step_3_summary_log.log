Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit to vectorise the `add_padding` function was successful. I can now proceed to vectorise the other functions.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done
2. Vectorise the forward function. In progress
3. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved. Not started
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. Not started








Fact Check:    
1. I have completed step 2, which is confirmed by the observation from the Edit Script (AI) action.
Thought:     I should continue vectorising the other functions.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The `convolution_step` function is a key component of the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Vectorising this function can significantly improve the execution speed of the CNN.

[Action]: Edited the `train_vectorised.py` script to vectorise the `convolution_step` function using numpy's `tensordot` function.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved as `train_vectorised.py`. The diff shows that the `np.sum(np.multiply(image_portion,kernel_matrix))` line has been replaced with `np.sum(np.tensordot(image_portion,kernel_matrix,axes=([1,2],[1,2])))`. This change effectively vectorises the convolution operation.
