Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the execution speed of the train.py script by vectorizing the forward function. To do this, it is necessary to first understand the script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorized.

[Action]: The action is to understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorized. The input to this action is the file name train.py and the things to look for are all possible ways where computation can be vectorized.

[Observation]: The observation is that there are four possible ways where computation can be vectorized in the train.py script:
1. The relu function can be vectorized using numpy's where function.
2. The add_padding function can be vectorized using numpy's pad function.
3. The convolution_step function can be vectorized using numpy's tensordot function.
4. The forward function can be vectorized using numpy's einsum function.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The `relu` function is a simple activation function that can be easily vectorised using numpy's `where` function.
[Action]: Edited the `train.py` script to vectorise the `relu` function using numpy's `where` function. Saved the edited script as `train_vectorised.py`.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `train_vectorised.py`. The diff shows that the `relu` function has been vectorised using numpy's `where` function.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The `add_padding` function can be vectorised using numpy's `pad` function, which can potentially improve the execution speed of the script.
[Action]: Edited the `train_vectorised.py` script to vectorise the `add_padding` function using numpy's `pad` function.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved as `train_vectorised.py`. The diff shows that the `add_padding` function has been modified to use numpy's `pad` function for padding.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The `convolution_step` function is a key component of the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Vectorising this function can significantly improve the execution speed of the CNN.

[Action]: Edited the `train_vectorised.py` script to vectorise the `convolution_step` function using numpy's `tensordot` function.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved as `train_vectorised.py`. The diff shows that the `np.sum(np.multiply(image_portion,kernel_matrix))` line has been replaced with `np.sum(np.tensordot(image_portion,kernel_matrix,axes=([1,2],[1,2])))`. This change effectively vectorises the convolution operation.
