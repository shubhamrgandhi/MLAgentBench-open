The diff shows the changes made to the script.\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to vectorise the identified computations. It is now necessary to run the script to observe the execution speed.\n[Action]: The script \"train_vectorized.py\" was executed.\n[Observation]: The script has been executed. The output of the script is not provided.\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n[Reasoning]: The goal is to check if the execution speed has been improved after vectorising the computations in the train.py script. The submission.csv file is expected to contain information about the execution time before and after vectorisation.\n\n[Action]: Understand File with the following input:\n{\n    \"file_name\": \"submission.csv\",\n    \"things_to_look_for\": \"Execution time before and after vectorisation.\"\n}\n\n[Observation]: An error message is displayed: \"EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/vectorization/7\\vectorization\\submission.csv\". This indicates that the submission.csv file cannot be found or accessed.\n\n",
