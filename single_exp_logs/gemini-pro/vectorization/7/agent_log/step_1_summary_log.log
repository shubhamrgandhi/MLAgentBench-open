Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have identified all possible ways where computation can be vectorised in the train.py script.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done.
2. Edit the script to vectorise the identified computations. In progress.
3. Run the script and observe the execution speed.
4. If the execution speed is not improved, revise the plan and try again.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: The train.py script can be vectorised.
Thought:   I should now edit the script to vectorise the identified computations.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Vectorize the identified computations.",
    "save_name": "train_vectorized.py"
}

        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The train.py script can be vectorised to improve execution speed.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to vectorise the identified computations and saved the edited file as train_vectorized.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_vectorized.py. The diff shows the changes made to the script.
