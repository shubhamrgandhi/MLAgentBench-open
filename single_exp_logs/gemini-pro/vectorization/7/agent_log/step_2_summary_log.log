===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script has been edited to vectorise the identified computations.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script and identify all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Done.
2. Edit the script to vectorise the identified computations. Done.
3. Run the script and observe the execution speed. In progress.
4. If the execution speed is not improved, revise the plan and try again.






Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The train.py script has been edited to vectorise the identified computations.
Thought:    I should now run the script and observe the execution speed.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train_vectorized.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to vectorise the identified computations. It is now necessary to run the script to observe the execution speed.
[Action]: The script "train_vectorized.py" was executed.
[Observation]: The script has been executed. The output of the script is not provided.
