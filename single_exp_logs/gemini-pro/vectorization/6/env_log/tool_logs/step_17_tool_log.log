===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Given a script train.py, execute it to see the current execution speed and then try to improve it with using only the numpy library and vectorisation in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123. Understand the train.py script well to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.

```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised. The observation is that in the given segment, no parts of the forward function can be vectorised.
[Action]: The action is to understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised.
[Observation]: The observation is that in the given segment, no parts of the forward function can be vectorised.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so the plan needs to be revised to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: Reflect on how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Observation]: None



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so the action should be revised to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Observation]: The observation is that the forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so there is no need to edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: None
[Observation]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The script train_optimised.py was executed to compare its execution speed with the original script.

[Action]: The script train_optimised.py was executed.

[Observation]: The script execution failed with an IndentationError on line 129.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The train_optimised.py script failed to execute due to an IndentationError on line 129.
[Action]: Edited the train_optimised.py script to fix the IndentationError on line 129 and saved the edited file as train_optimised_fixed.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_optimised_fixed.py. The diff shows that the IndentationError on line 129 has been fixed.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The train_optimised_fixed.py script has an IndentationError on line 129.
[Action]: Execute Script
[Observation]: The script has been executed, but there is an IndentationError on line 129 in the train_optimised_fixed.py script.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.
- Attempts to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function were unsuccessful.
- The train_optimised.py script failed to execute due to an IndentationError on line 129.
- The edited file train_optimised_fixed.py still has an IndentationError on line 129.
