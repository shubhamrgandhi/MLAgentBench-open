Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised. The observation is that in the given segment, no parts of the forward function can be vectorised.

[Observation]: The observation is that in the given segment, no parts of the forward function can be vectorised.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so the plan needs to be revised to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: Reflect on how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Observation]: None
