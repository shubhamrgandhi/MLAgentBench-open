Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised. The observation is that in the given segment, no parts of the forward function can be vectorised.
[Action]: The action is to understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised.
[Observation]: The observation is that in the given segment, no parts of the forward function can be vectorised.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so the plan needs to be revised to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: Reflect on how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Observation]: None



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so the action should be revised to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Observation]: The observation is that the forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so there is no need to edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: None
[Observation]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.
