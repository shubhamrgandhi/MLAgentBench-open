Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The script train_optimised.py failed to execute due to an IndentationError on line 129.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised.
2. Revise the plan to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
3. Understand how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
4. Edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
5. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved.
6. If the execution speed has not improved, revise the plan and try again.
7. Fix the IndentationError in the train_optimised.py script.
8. Run the optimised script and compare the execution speed with the original script.






Fact Check:  
1. The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.
2. This is directly confirmed by the observation from the Understand File action.
Thought:   I should fix the IndentationError in the train_optimised.py script.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train_optimised.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Fix the IndentationError on line 129.",

}

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The train_optimised.py script failed to execute due to an IndentationError on line 129.
[Action]: Edited the train_optimised.py script to fix the IndentationError on line 129 and saved the edited file as train_optimised_fixed.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_optimised_fixed.py. The diff shows that the IndentationError on line 129 has been fixed.
