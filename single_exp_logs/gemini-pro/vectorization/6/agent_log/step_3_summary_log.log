Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    I have understood how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function. I need to edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script and identify the parts that can be vectorised.
2. Revise the plan to focus on optimising the vectorised parts of the forward function.
3. Understand how to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
4. Edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
5. Run the script to see if the execution speed has improved.
6. If the execution speed has not improved, revise the plan and try again.








Fact Check:    
1. The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised.
2. This is directly confirmed by the observation from the Understand File action.
Thought:     I should edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.",
    "save_name": "train_optimised.py"
}

[Reasoning]: The forward function in the train.py script is already vectorised, so there is no need to edit the script to optimise the vectorised parts of the forward function.
[Action]: None
