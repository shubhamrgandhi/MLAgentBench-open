===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The execution of the fixed script "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py" still resulted in a SyntaxError: invalid syntax. This means that the error is not resolved.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.










Fact Check:    
1. The execution of the fixed script "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py" still resulted in a SyntaxError: invalid syntax: directly confirmed by the Execute Script action.
Thought:     I should inspect the script again to see if there are any other errors.
Action:     Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:    
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py",
    "start_line_number": 137,
    "end_line_number": 137
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 137):

        writer = csv.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py" still resulted in a SyntaxError: invalid syntax, so I need to inspect the script again to see if there are any other errors.
[Action]: Inspected lines 137 of the script "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py".
[Observation]: Line 137 of the script is "writer = csv.".
