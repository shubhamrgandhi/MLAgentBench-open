Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The inspection of the script shows that there is a missing closing parenthesis in line 137. This is likely the cause of the SyntaxError: invalid syntax.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.












Fact Check:     
1. The inspection of the script shows that there is a missing closing parenthesis in line 137: directly confirmed by the Inspect Script Lines action.
Thought:      I should fix the missing closing parenthesis in line 137 and execute the script again to see if the error is resolved.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script has a missing closing parenthesis in line 137, which is likely causing the SyntaxError.
[Action]: Edited the script to add the missing closing parenthesis in line 137 and saved the edited file as "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed.py".
[Observation]: The edited file is saved successfully. The diff shows that the closing parenthesis is added in line 137.
