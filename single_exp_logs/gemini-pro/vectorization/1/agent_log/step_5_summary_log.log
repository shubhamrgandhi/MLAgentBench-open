Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The SyntaxError: unterminated string literal is likely due to the missing closing quotation mark at the end of the string literal "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]".
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.






Fact Check:  
1. The SyntaxError: unterminated string literal is likely due to the missing closing quotation mark at the end of the string literal "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]": guessed.
Thought:   I should fix the typo in the script "train_vectorised.py" by adding the missing closing quotation mark.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The SyntaxError: unterminated string literal is likely due to the missing closing quotation mark at the end of the string literal "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]".
[Action]: Edited the script "train_vectorised.py" by adding the missing closing quotation mark in line 27 and saved the edited file as "train_vectorised_fixed.py".
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_vectorised_fixed.py. The diff shows that the closing quotation mark is added at the end of the string literal "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]".
