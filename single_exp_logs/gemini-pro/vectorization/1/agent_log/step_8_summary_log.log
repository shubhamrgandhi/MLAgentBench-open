===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The error is likely due to the incomplete line of code on line 137. The line should be completed with a function call or assignment.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.








Fact Check:   
1. The error is likely due to the incomplete line of code on line 137: guessed.
Thought:    I should fix the incomplete line of code on line 137 by adding the missing function call.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised_fixed.py",
    "edit_instruction": "In line 137, add the function call `writer.writerow(row)`.",
    "save_name": "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train_vectorised_fixed_fixed.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
