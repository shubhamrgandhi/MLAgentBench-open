===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The execution of the script "train_vectorised_fixed.py" resulted in a SyntaxError: invalid syntax. This error is likely due to an error in the code.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.








Fact Check:   
1. The execution of the script "train_vectorised_fixed.py" resulted in a SyntaxError: invalid syntax: directly confirmed by the Execute Script action.
Thought:    I should debug the script "train_vectorised_fixed.py" to fix the SyntaxError.
Action:    Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:   
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised_fixed.py",
    "start_line_number": 137,
    "end_line_number": 137
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 137):

        writer = csv.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
