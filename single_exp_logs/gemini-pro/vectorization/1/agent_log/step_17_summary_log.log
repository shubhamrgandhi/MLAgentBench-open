===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:        The inspection of the script shows that line 137 is still incomplete and contains a syntax error. The parenthesis is not closed.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.
















Fact Check:       
1. The inspection of the script shows that line 137 is still incomplete and contains a syntax error: directly confirmed by the Inspect Script Lines action.
Thought:        I should complete line 137 by adding the closing parenthesis.
Action:        Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:       
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed_fixed.py",
    "edit_instruction": "In line 137, add a closing parenthesis after `writer = csv.writer(`.",
    "save_name": "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed_fixed.py"
}

        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
