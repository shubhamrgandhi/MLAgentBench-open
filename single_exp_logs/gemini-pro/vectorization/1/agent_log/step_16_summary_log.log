Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The execution of the fixed script "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed_fixed.py" still resulted in a SyntaxError: '(' was never closed. This means that the error is not resolved.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.
















Fact Check:       
1. The execution of the fixed script "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed_fixed.py" still resulted in a SyntaxError: '(' was never closed: directly confirmed by the Execute Script action.
Thought:        I should inspect the script again to see if there are any other errors.
Action:        Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:       
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed_fixed.py",
    "start_line_number": 137,
    "end_line_number": 137
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 137):

        writer = csv.writer(
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
