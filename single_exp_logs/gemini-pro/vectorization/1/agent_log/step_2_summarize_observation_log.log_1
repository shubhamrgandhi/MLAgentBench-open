Reflection:    The forward pass function iterates over the batch of input features, applies padding if specified, and performs convolution operations using the layer's kernel matrices and biases. The convolution operation is not vectorised, which can be done by using NumPy's built-in functions.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.




Fact Check:    
1. The convolution operation in the forward pass function is not vectorised: directly confirmed by the Inspect Script Lines action.
Thought:    I should implement the vectorisation of the convolution operation using NumPy's built-in functions.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "In the forward pass function, replace the loop over the batch of input features with a single NumPy operation using the `np.convolve()` function.",
    "save_name": "train_vectorised.py"
}

[Observation]:
- The convolution operation in the forward pass function is not vectorised.
- The convolution operation is a for loop which iterates over all the image's and feature's dimensions.
- The convolution operation is a dot product between the filter and the image's portion.
- The result of the convolution operation is then added to the output matrix.
