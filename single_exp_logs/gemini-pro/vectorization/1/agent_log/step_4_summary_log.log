===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The execution of the script "train_vectorised.py" resulted in a SyntaxError: unterminated string literal. This error is likely due to a typo in the script.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.






Fact Check: 
1. The execution of the script "train_vectorised.py" resulted in a SyntaxError: unterminated string literal: directly confirmed by the Execute Script action.
Thought:  I should debug the script "train_vectorised.py" to fix the SyntaxError.
Action:  Inspect Script Lines
Action Input: 
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised.py",
    "start_line_number": 27,
    "end_line_number": 27
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 137):

    assert (len(X.shape) == 4), "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The SyntaxError: unterminated string literal is likely due to a typo in the script.
[Action]: Inspected the script "train_vectorised.py" line 27.
[Observation]: Line 27 of the script contains the following code:

```
assert (len(X.shape) == 4), "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]
```

The error is likely due to the missing closing quotation mark at the end of the string literal "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]".
