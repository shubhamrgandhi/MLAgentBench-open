===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The Edit Script (AI) action was successful in fixing the typo in the script "train_vectorised.py".
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.






Fact Check:  
1. The Edit Script (AI) action was successful in fixing the typo in the script "train_vectorised.py": directly confirmed by the Edit Script (AI) action.
Thought:   I should measure the performance improvement of the vectorised version of the script.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:  
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised_fixed.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

  File "C:\Users\2671148\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\vectorization\1\vectorization\train_vectorised_fixed.py", line 137
    writer = csv.
                 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
