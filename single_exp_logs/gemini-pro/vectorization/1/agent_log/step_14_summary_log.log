Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The inspection of the script shows that line 137 is incomplete and contains a syntax error.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the train.py script.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.














Fact Check:      
1. The inspection of the script shows that line 137 is incomplete and contains a syntax error: directly confirmed by the Inspect Script Lines action.
Thought:       I should complete line 137 by adding the necessary code to open the CSV file for writing.
Action:       Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: Line 137 of the script was incomplete and contained a syntax error. To fix this, the code to open the CSV file for writing needed to be added.
[Action]: In line 137 of the script, the code `open('submission.csv', 'w')` was added after `csv.` to open the CSV file for writing. The edited file was saved as `train_vectorised_fixed_fixed_fixed_fixed.py`.
[Observation]: The edited file was saved successfully. The diff shows that the code `open('submission.csv', 'w')` was added in line 137.
