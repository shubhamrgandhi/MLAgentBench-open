===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The unterminated string literal in the train_vectorised.py script is in line 26. I need to fix the string literal to make the script run.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script and the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and run the script to see the improvement.
4. Store the run time in submission.csv.








Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The unterminated string literal in the train_vectorised.py script is in line 26.
Thought:     I should edit the script to fix the unterminated string literal.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:

    "script_name": "train_vectorised.py",
    "edit_instruction": "In line 26, fix the unterminated string literal by adding a closing quotation mark.",
    "save_name": "train_vectorised.py"
