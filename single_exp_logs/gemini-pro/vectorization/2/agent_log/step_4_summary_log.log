===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The convolution operation in the forward function of the Conv2DLayer class has been vectorised using NumPy's einsum function. Now I need to run the script to see the improvement.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script and the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and run the script to see the improvement.
4. Store the run time in submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The convolution operation in the forward function of the Conv2DLayer class has been vectorised using NumPy's einsum function.
Thought:    I should run the train_vectorised.py script and compare the run time with the original train.py script.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train_vectorised.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

  File "C:\Users\2671148\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\vectorization\2\vectorization\train_vectorised.py", line 26
    assert (len(X.shape) == 4), "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]
                                ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 26)

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script train_vectorised.py was executed to compare the run time with the original train.py script.

[Action]: The script train_vectorised.py was executed.

[Observation]: The execution of the script train_vectorised.py resulted in a SyntaxError: unterminated string literal.
