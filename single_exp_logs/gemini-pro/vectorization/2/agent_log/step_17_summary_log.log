Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The train_vectorised.py script still has a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed. I need to debug the script to find the error.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the train.py script and the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and run the script to see the improvement.
4. Store the run time in submission.csv.










Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The train_vectorised.py script still has a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.
Thought:      I should inspect the script to find the error.
Action:      Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:     
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised.py",
    "start_line_number": 119,
    "end_line_number": 119
}

 
        [Observation]:

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
