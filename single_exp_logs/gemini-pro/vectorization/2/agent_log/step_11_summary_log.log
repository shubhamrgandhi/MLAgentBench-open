===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The train_vectorised.py script still has a SyntaxError: unterminated string literal. I need to debug the script to find the error.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the train.py script and the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and run the script to see the improvement.
4. Store the run time in submission.csv.






Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The train_vectorised.py script still has a SyntaxError: unterminated string literal.
Thought:    I should inspect the script to find the unterminated string literal.
Action:    Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:   
{
    "script_name": "train_vectorised.py",
    "start_line_number": 26,
    "end_line_number": 26
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 121):

    assert (len(X.shape) == 4), "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The SyntaxError: unterminated string literal is likely caused by a missing closing quotation mark in the script.
[Action]: Inspect the script line 26.
[Observation]: Line 26 of the script is:

```
assert (len(X.shape) == 4), "Input image should be form of [Batch, Width, Height, Channels]
```

The closing quotation mark is missing at the end of the string.
