Reflection:    The forward function in the Conv2DLayer class iterates over the batch of input features, applies padding if specified, and convolves each portion of the input with the layer's kernel matrices. The resulting feature maps are then passed through the activation function (if specified). It seems that the convolution operation can be vectorised.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the train.py script and the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
3. Implement the vectorisation and run the script to see the improvement.
4. Store the run time in submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The forward function in the Conv2DLayer class iterates over the batch of input features, applies padding if specified, and convolves each portion of the input with the layer's kernel matrices. The resulting feature maps are then passed through the activation function (if specified).
Thought:    I should use the Edit Script (AI) action to vectorise the convolution operation.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py",

**Observation**:

- The forward function in the Conv2DLayer class iterates over the batch of input features, applies padding if specified, and convolves each portion of the input with the layer's kernel matrices.
- The resulting feature maps are then passed through the activation function (if specified).
- The convolution operation can be vectorized using NumPy's einsum function to perform the matrix multiplication between the image portion and the kernel matrix.
