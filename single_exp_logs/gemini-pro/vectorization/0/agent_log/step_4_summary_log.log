===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The error is in the vectorized forward pass code. The `einsum` function is being used to perform the convolution operation, but the operands are not being broadcast correctly.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script. Done.
2. Identify the parts of the script where vectorisation can be applied. Done.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement. In progress.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.





Fact Check:  
1. It is directly confirmed by the observation that the error is in the vectorized forward pass code.
Thought:   I need to fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:  
```
{
  "script_name": "train_vectorized.py",
  "edit_instruction": "Fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function.",
  "save_name": "train_vectorized_fixed.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
         The error in the vectorized forward pass code is due to incorrect broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function, which is used to perform the convolution operation.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error is in the vectorized forward pass code, specifically in the broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function.
[Action]: Edited the script `train_vectorized.py` to fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function and saved the edited script as `train_vectorized_fixed.py`.
[Observation]: The observation confirms that the error is in the vectorized forward pass code due to incorrect broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function.
