Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The execution of the script failed with a syntax error in line 27.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the train.py script. Done.
2. Identify the parts of the script where vectorisation can be applied. Done.
3. Vectorize the forward function and measure the performance improvement. In progress.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py. In progress.

















Fact Check:       
1. It is directly confirmed by the observation that the execution of the script failed with a syntax error in line 27.
Thought:       I need to fix the syntax error in line 27 of the script.
Action:       Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:       
```
{
  "script_name": "train_vectorized_fixed.py",
  "edit_instruction": "Fix the syntax error in line 27.",
  "save_name": "train_vectorized_fixed.py"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train_vectorized_fixed.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
