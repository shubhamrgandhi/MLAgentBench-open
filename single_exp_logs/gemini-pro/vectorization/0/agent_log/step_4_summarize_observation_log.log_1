Reflection:   The error is in the vectorized forward pass code. The `einsum` function is being used to perform the convolution operation, but the operands are not being broadcast correctly.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script. Done.
2. Identify the parts of the script where vectorisation can be applied. Done.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement. In progress.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.





Fact Check:  
1. It is directly confirmed by the observation that the error is in the vectorized forward pass code.
Thought:   I need to fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:  
```
{
  "script_name": "train_vectorized.py",
  "edit_instruction": "Fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function.",
  "save_name": "train_vectorized_fixed.py"

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Observation]: The error in the vectorized forward pass code is due to incorrect broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function. The `einsum` function is used to perform the convolution operation, but the operands are not being broadcast correctly.
