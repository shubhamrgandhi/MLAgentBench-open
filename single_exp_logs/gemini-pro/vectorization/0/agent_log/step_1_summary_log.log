Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the overall structure of the train.py script, the forward function, and identified the parts of the script that can be vectorised.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the train.py script. Done.
2. Identify the parts of the script where vectorisation can be applied. Done.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.




Fact Check:  
1. It is directly confirmed by the observation that the forward function can be vectorised by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation.
Thought:   I should now implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:  
```
{
  "script_name": "train.py",
  "edit_instruction": "Vectorize the forward function using numpy's einsum function.",
  "save_name": "train_vectorized.py"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train_vectorized.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The forward function can be vectorised by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation. This should improve the performance of the script.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to vectorise the forward function using numpy's `einsum` function and saved the edited script as train_vectorized.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_vectorized.py. The diff shows that the forward function has been vectorised using numpy's `einsum` function.
