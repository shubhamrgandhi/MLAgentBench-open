===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit script action was successful. The error in the vectorized forward pass code is due to incorrect broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function, which is used to perform the convolution operation.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. 
```
Revise
```
the train.py script. Done.
2. Identify the parts of the script where vectorisation can be applied. Done.
3. 
```
Revise
```
Vectorize the forward function and measure the performance improvement. In progress.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.







Fact Check:   
1. It is directly confirmed by the observation that the error in the vectorized forward pass code is due to incorrect broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function.
Thought:    I need to fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function.
Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   
```
{
  "script_name": "train_vectorized_fixed.py",
  "edit_instruction": "Fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function.",
  "save_name": "train_vectorized_fixed.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]:
The error in the vectorized forward pass code is due to incorrect broadcasting ofoperands in the `numpy.dot` function.

[Action]:
Edit the `train_vectorized.py` script to fix the broadcasting issue in the `numpy.dot` function.

[Observation]:
The `numpy.dot` function is replaced with `numpy.tensordot` with the correct axes specified for broadcasting.
