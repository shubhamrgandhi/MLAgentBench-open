===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The script execution failed with a ValueError. The error message indicates that the operands could not be broadcast together with remapped shapes.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the train.py script. Done.
2. Identify the parts of the script where vectorisation can be applied. Done.
3. Implement the vectorisation and measure the performance improvement. Done.
4. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.



Fact Check: 
1. It is directly confirmed by the observation that the script execution failed with a ValueError.
Thought:  I need to debug the script and fix the error before I can measure the performance improvement.
Action:  Inspect Script Lines
Action Input: 
```
{
  "script_name": "train_vectorized.py",
  "start_line_number": 104,
  "end_line_number": 108
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 127):


        # Vectorized Forward Pass
        output = np.einsum('bijk,ijkl->bijl', padded_batch, self.kernel_matrices) + self.biases
        
        if self.activation == 'relu': # apply activation Function. 
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error message indicates that the operands could not be broadcast together with remapped shapes. The vectorized forward pass is a potential cause of this error.
[Action]: Inspected the lines of code in the script train_vectorized.py from line 104 to line 108.
[Observation]: The code in these lines performs a vectorized forward pass using the einsum function. The einsum function is used to perform Einstein summation over multiple arrays. In this case, it is used to compute the matrix multiplication between the padded batch and the kernel matrices, and then add the biases. The output of this operation is then passed through a ReLU activation function.
