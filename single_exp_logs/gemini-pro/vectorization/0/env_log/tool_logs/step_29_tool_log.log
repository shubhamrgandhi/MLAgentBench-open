We are trying to solve this research problem: Given a script train.py, execute it to see the current execution speed and then try to improve it with using only the numpy library and vectorisation in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123. Understand the train.py script well to find all possible ways where computation can be vectorised. Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.

```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is the starting point for understanding how to vectorize the code.
[Action]: Understand the overall structure of the script, the forward function, and any other parts of the script that can be vectorized.
[Observation]: The overall structure of the script, the forward function, and any other parts of the script that can be vectorized were identified. The forward function can be vectorized by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The forward function can be vectorised by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation. This should improve the performance of the script.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to vectorise the forward function using numpy's `einsum` function and saved the edited script as train_vectorized.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_vectorized.py. The diff shows that the forward function has been vectorised using numpy's `einsum` function.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous action was to execute the script train_vectorized.py to measure the performance improvement after vectorizing the forward function.

[Action]: The script train_vectorized.py was executed.

[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with remapped shapes.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The error message indicates that the operands could not be broadcast together with remapped shapes. The vectorized forward pass is a potential cause of this error.
[Action]: Inspected the lines of code in the script train_vectorized.py from line 104 to line 108.
[Observation]: The code in these lines performs a vectorized forward pass using the einsum function. The einsum function is used to perform Einstein summation over multiple arrays. In this case, it is used to compute the matrix multiplication between the padded batch and the kernel matrices, and then add the biases. The output of this operation is then passed through a ReLU activation function.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The error is in the vectorized forward pass code, specifically in the broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function.
[Action]: Edited the script `train_vectorized.py` to fix the broadcasting issue in the `einsum` function and saved the edited script as `train_vectorized_fixed.py`.
[Observation]: The observation confirms that the error is in the vectorized forward pass code due to incorrect broadcasting of operands in the `einsum` function.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]:
The error in the vectorized forward pass code is due to incorrect broadcasting ofoperands in the `numpy.dot` function.

[Action]:
Edit the `train_vectorized.py` script to fix the broadcasting issue in the `numpy.dot` function.

[Observation]:
The `numpy.dot` function is replaced with `numpy.tensordot` with the correct axes specified for broadcasting.
