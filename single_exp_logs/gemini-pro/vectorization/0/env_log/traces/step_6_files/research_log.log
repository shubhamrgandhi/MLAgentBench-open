Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is the starting point for understanding how to vectorize the code.
[Action]: Understand the overall structure of the script, the forward function, and any other parts of the script that can be vectorized.
[Observation]: The overall structure of the script, the forward function, and any other parts of the script that can be vectorized were identified. The forward function can be vectorized by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The forward function can be vectorised by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation. This should improve the performance of the script.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to vectorise the forward function using numpy's `einsum` function and saved the edited script as train_vectorized.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_vectorized.py. The diff shows that the forward function has been vectorised using numpy's `einsum` function.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous action was to execute the script train_vectorized.py to measure the performance improvement after vectorizing the forward function.

[Action]: The script train_vectorized.py was executed.

[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with remapped shapes.
