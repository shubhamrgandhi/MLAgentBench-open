Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is the starting point for understanding how to vectorize the code.
[Action]: Understand the overall structure of the script, the forward function, and any other parts of the script that can be vectorized.
[Observation]: The overall structure of the script, the forward function, and any other parts of the script that can be vectorized were identified. The forward function can be vectorized by using numpy's `einsum` function to perform the convolution operation.
