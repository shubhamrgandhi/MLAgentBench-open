===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem:
    - The goal is to create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review.
    - The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt.
    - Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
        - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
        - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.
2. Design the system:
    - The system will consist of the following components:
        - A query generator to generate queries for the arxiv API.
        - A paper retriever to retrieve papers from the arxiv API.
        - A paper summarizer to summarize the papers using the LLM.
        - A report generator to generate the report.
3. Implement the system:
    - I will implement the system using Python.
4. Evaluate the system:
    - I will evaluate the system on a set of research topics.


Fact Check:  
- The goal is to create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. (guessed)
- The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. (guessed)
- Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review. (guessed)
Thought:  I need to first understand the arxiv API and the LLM API.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": [".", "arxiv_API_reference.txt", "claude_example.py", "claude_api_key.txt"]
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries. Please use the correct format and try again:
{
            dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation is that the action input is not in a valid JSON format.
