===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation is that the action input is not in a valid JSON format.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The error message indicates that the JSON input for List Files is not valid and needs to be in the correct format.
[Action]: The action is to use the correct format for List Files, which is:
```
{
    dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
```
[Observation]: The observation is that the error message is telling the user that the JSON input for List Files is not valid and needs to be in the correct format.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid JSON with proper entries.
[Action]: List Files with the following JSON input:
```
{
    "dir_path": [".", "arxiv_API_reference.txt", "claude_example.py", "claude_api_key.txt"]
}
```
[Observation]: The observation is an error message:
```
EnvError: The action input for List Files needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries. Please use the correct format and try again:
{
            dir_path: [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
}
```



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The error message indicates that the JSON input for the List Files action is invalid due to a missing comma between entries.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory and the specified paths: ".", "arxiv_API_reference.txt", "claude_example.py", and "claude_api_key.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is an error message stating that the JSON input is invalid and needs to be corrected.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The error message indicates that the JSON input for the List Files action is invalid due to a missing comma between entries.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory and the specified paths: ".", "arxiv_API_reference.txt", "claude_example.py", and "claude_api_key.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is an error message stating that the JSON input is invalid and needs to be corrected.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The research aims to create an AI system for literature review using a large language model (LLM) and the Anthropic API.
- The system should take a research topic as input, retrieve related papers from the arXiv API, summarize them using the LLM, and generate a report.
- The report should include a list of papers, summaries of each paper, and a conclusion of the literature review.
- The current research log includes several steps where the system attempts to list files in the current directory and encounters errors due to invalid JSON input.
- The error messages indicate that the JSON input for the List Files action is invalid due to missing commas between entries.
- The research log also includes a reference to the arXiv API and a file named claude_api_key.txt, which suggests that the Anthropic API will be used for accessing the LLM.
