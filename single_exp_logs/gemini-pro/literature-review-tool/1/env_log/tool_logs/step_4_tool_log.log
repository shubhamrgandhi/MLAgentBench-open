===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "problem_statement.txt" to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool\problem_statement.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

[Action]: Reflection

[Observation]: The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
1. **Define the research question or topic:** Clearly articulate the research question or topic that the literature review will address. This will guide the search for relevant literature and ensure that the review is focused and coherent.


2. **Conduct a comprehensive literature search:** Utilize various sources, such as academic databases, search engines, and reference lists of relevant studies, to gather a comprehensive collection of literature related to the research question.


3. **Organize and manage the literature:** Employ tools and techniques to organize and manage the collected literature efficiently. This may involve creating a reference management system, categorizing studies based on specific criteria, or using software to assist in the review process.


4. **Critically evaluate the literature:** Carefully assess the quality, relevance, and validity of each study included in the review. This involves examining the research methods, findings, and conclusions to determine their strengths and limitations.


5. **Synthesize and analyze the findings:** Identify common themes, patterns, and gaps in the literature. Analyze the findings of individual studies to identify key insights, trends, and relationships. This step involves interpreting and integrating the results of the included studies to draw meaningful conclusions.


6. **Write the literature review:** Structure the literature review in a logical and coherent manner, typically consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction provides an overview of the research question and the purpose of the review. The body presents the findings of the literature search, organized and analyzed according to specific themes or categories. The conclusion summarizes the key findings, highlights the implications of the review, and identifies areas for future research.


7. **Proofread and revise:** Carefully proofread the literature review to ensure accuracy, clarity, and consistency in writing style and formatting. Revise the review based on feedback from peers, supervisors, or editors to improve its quality and impact.
