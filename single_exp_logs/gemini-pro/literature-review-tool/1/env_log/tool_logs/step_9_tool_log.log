We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "problem_statement.txt" to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool\problem_statement.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

[Action]: Reflection

[Observation]: The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Observation]: The agent has identified seven steps involved in creating a literature review tool:
1. Define the research question or topic.
2. Conduct a comprehensive literature search.
3. Organize and manage the literature.
4. Critically evaluate the literature.
5. Synthesize and analyze the findings.
6. Write the literature review.
7. Proofread and revise.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The research plan is to understand the problem statement and the tools available, come up with a high level plan, and then start implementing the plan. The first two steps have been completed.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation is that there are four files and one directory in the current directory: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
The research question or topic is to create a literature review tool that can be used to generate a report on a given research topic. The tool should be able to:

* Call the arXiv API to get a list of related papers.
* Use a large language model (LLM) to summarize these papers.
* Generate a report that includes the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.

The tool should be easy to use and should be able to generate high-quality reports. It should also be able to handle a variety of research topics.

The research plan is to first understand the problem statement and the tools available. Then, a high-level plan will be developed. Finally, the plan will be implemented and the tool will be evaluated.

The expected outcome of the research is a literature review tool that can be used by researchers to quickly and easily generate high-quality reports on a variety of research topics.
