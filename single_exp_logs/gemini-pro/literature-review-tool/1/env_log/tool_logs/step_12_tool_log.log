We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "problem_statement.txt" to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool\problem_statement.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

[Action]: Reflection

[Observation]: The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Observation]: The agent has identified seven steps involved in creating a literature review tool:
1. Define the research question or topic.
2. Conduct a comprehensive literature search.
3. Organize and manage the literature.
4. Critically evaluate the literature.
5. Synthesize and analyze the findings.
6. Write the literature review.
7. Proofread and revise.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The research plan is to understand the problem statement and the tools available, come up with a high level plan, and then start implementing the plan. The first two steps have been completed.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation is that there are four files and one directory in the current directory: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the research question or topic.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the research question or topic.
[Observation]: The research question or topic is to create a literature review tool that can be used to generate a report on a given research topic. The tool should be able to call the arXiv API to get a list of related papers, use a large language model (LLM) to summarize these papers, and generate a report that includes the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review. The tool should be easy to use and should be able to generate high-quality reports. It should also be able to handle a variety of research topics.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
There are several ways to conduct a comprehensive literature search. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Keyword Search:**

   - Use relevant keywords and phrases related to your research topic.
   - Search academic databases, search engines, and online repositories.
   - Utilize Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine keywords effectively.
   - Consider synonyms, alternative spellings, and related concepts to expand your search.

2. **Citation Tracking:**

   - Examine the reference lists of relevant articles, books, and other publications.
   - Use citation tracking tools to identify frequently cited works and influential authors.
   - Explore the "cited by" feature in academic databases to find articles that have cited a particular source.

3. **Subject Headings and Classification Systems:**

   - Utilize subject headings and classification systems specific to your field of study.
   - Search library catalogs, online databases, and specialized resources using these controlled vocabularies.
   - Explore the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) or the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) systems.

4. **Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Approaches:**

   - Expand your search beyond your primary field of study to include related disciplines.
   - Explore interdisciplinary databases and resources that cover multiple subject areas.
   - Consider the broader context and implications of your research topic.

5. **Conference Proceedings and Workshops:**

   - Search conference proceedings, workshop papers, and symposium presentations.
   - Utilize conference websites, academic databases, and specialized repositories.
   - Attend conferences and workshops to network with researchers and discover new developments.

6. **Preprints and Working Papers:**

   - Explore preprint servers and repositories for early research findings and unpublished works.
   - Search platforms like arXiv, bioRxiv, and SSRN for relevant preprints.
   - Consider the limitations and potential biases associated with preprints.

7. **Expert Recommendations and Peer Review:**

   - Consult with experts, advisors, and peers in your field for recommendations.
   - Seek feedback on your search strategy and potential sources.
   - Participate in peer review processes to gain insights into the latest research.

8. **Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses:**

   - Utilize systematic reviews and meta-analyses that provide comprehensive summaries of existing research.
   - Identify key findings, trends, and gaps in the literature.
   - Consider conducting your own systematic review or meta-analysis if appropriate.

9. **Social Media and Online Communities:**

   - Join academic social media platforms, forums, and online communities related to your research topic.
   - Engage in discussions, ask questions, and share your findings.
   - Discover new research, resources, and potential collaborators.

10. **Time Range and Language Considerations:**

    - Determine the appropriate time range for your literature search based on the recency and relevance of the information.
    - Consider searching for literature in multiple languages to capture a broader range of perspectives.
    - Utilize translation tools or collaborate with multilingual researchers if necessary.

By employing a combination of these strategies and adapting your search approach to the specific requirements of your research topic, you can conduct a comprehensive and effective literature search.
