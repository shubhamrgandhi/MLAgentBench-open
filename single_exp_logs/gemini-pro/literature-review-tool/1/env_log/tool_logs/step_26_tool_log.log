We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "problem_statement.txt" to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool\problem_statement.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

[Action]: Reflection

[Observation]: The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Observation]: The agent has identified seven steps involved in creating a literature review tool:
1. Define the research question or topic.
2. Conduct a comprehensive literature search.
3. Organize and manage the literature.
4. Critically evaluate the literature.
5. Synthesize and analyze the findings.
6. Write the literature review.
7. Proofread and revise.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The research plan is to understand the problem statement and the tools available, come up with a high level plan, and then start implementing the plan. The first two steps have been completed.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation is that there are four files and one directory in the current directory: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the research question or topic.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the research question or topic.
[Observation]: The research question or topic is to create a literature review tool that can be used to generate a report on a given research topic. The tool should be able to call the arXiv API to get a list of related papers, use a large language model (LLM) to summarize these papers, and generate a report that includes the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review. The tool should be easy to use and should be able to generate high-quality reports. It should also be able to handle a variety of research topics.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The research plan includes conducting a comprehensive literature search as the next step.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on different ways to conduct a comprehensive literature search.
[Observation]: The observation is a list of different ways to conduct a comprehensive literature search, including keyword search, citation tracking, subject headings and classification systems, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches, conference proceedings and workshops, preprints and working papers, expert recommendations and peer review, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, social media and online communities, and time range and language considerations.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The action is to reflect on the different ways to organize and manage the literature.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on the different ways to organize and manage the literature.
[Observation]: There are several ways to organize and manage the literature for a literature review, including using reference management software, creating a literature matrix, using a file system, annotating and summarizing, creating a literature map, and using a collaborative tool.



Step 7:
[Reasoning]: The action is to reflect on different ways to critically evaluate the literature. The observation provides a detailed explanation of the different aspects to consider when critically evaluating the literature.

[Action]: The action is to reflect on different ways to critically evaluate the literature.

[Observation]: Critically evaluating the literature involves assessing the research design and methodology, validity and reliability, bias and conflict of interest, generalizability and applicability, currency and significance, synthesis and integration, and limitations and strengths of the studies. This process helps to identify high-quality studies, assess the validity and reliability of the findings, and gain a deeper understanding of the research topic.



Step 8:
[Reasoning]: The action is to reflect on different ways to synthesize and analyze the findings of a literature review.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on different ways to synthesize and analyze the findings of a literature review.
[Observation]: The observation provides a detailed explanation of various methods for synthesizing and analyzing findings in a literature review, including narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, systematic review, thematic analysis, grounded theory, and meta-synthesis. It highlights the purpose, process, and outcomes of each method, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate method based on the research question, type of studies, and desired outcomes.



Step 9:
[Reasoning]: The action is to reflect on different ways to write a literature review. The observation is that there are several different ways to write a literature review, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on different ways to write a literature review.
[Observation]: There are several different ways to write a literature review, including narrative reviews, systematic reviews, meta-syntheses, and scoping reviews. The best type of literature review for a particular project will depend on the specific research question and the available resources.
