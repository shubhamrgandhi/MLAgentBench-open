We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.
    Your current research log:
    ```
    

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "problem_statement.txt" to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool\problem_statement.txt".


    ```
    Reflect on this: Where can I find the problem statement? 
    Give an answer in natural language paragraphs as truthfully as possible. 
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.

To find the problem statement, the agent should use all of the information that it has available. This includes the error message that it encountered, the directory structure of the project, and the names of the files that are in the project. The agent should also consider the context of the problem. What is the purpose of the project? What are the goals of the research? Once the agent has a good understanding of the context of the problem, it will be better able to find the problem statement.
