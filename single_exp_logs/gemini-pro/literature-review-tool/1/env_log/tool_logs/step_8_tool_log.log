We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "problem_statement.txt" to understand the problem statement and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool\problem_statement.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

[Action]: Reflection

[Observation]: The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Action]: The agent is reflecting on the steps involved in creating a literature review tool.
[Observation]: The agent has identified seven steps involved in creating a literature review tool:
1. Define the research question or topic.
2. Conduct a comprehensive literature search.
3. Organize and manage the literature.
4. Critically evaluate the literature.
5. Synthesize and analyze the findings.
6. Write the literature review.
7. Proofread and revise.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The research plan is to understand the problem statement and the tools available, come up with a high level plan, and then start implementing the plan. The first two steps have been completed.
[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The observation is that there are four files and one directory in the current directory: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.
