===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The file problem_statement.txt does not exist. I need to find another way to understand the problem statement.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem statement and the tools available.
2. Come up with a high level plan.
3. Start implementing the plan.




Fact Check:   
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Guessed: I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
3. Guessed: Understand the problem statement and the tools available.
4. Guessed: Come up with a high level plan.
5. Guessed: Start implementing the plan.
Thought:   I should try to find the problem statement in the instructions.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
 "things_to_reflect_on": "Where can I find the problem statement?"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: The agent is unable to find the problem statement because it is looking for a file named "problem_statement.txt" in the directory "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/1\literature-review-tool". However, this file does not exist.

The agent should look for the problem statement in a different location. The problem statement may be in a different file, or it may be in a different directory. The agent should also consider the possibility that the problem statement is not in a text file at all. It may be in a different format, such as a PDF or a Word document.

To find the problem statement, the agent should use all of the information that it has available. This includes the error message that it encountered, the directory structure of the project, and the names of the files that are in the project. The agent should also consider the context of the problem. What is the purpose of the project? What are the goals of the research? Once the agent has a good understanding of the context of the problem, it will be better able to find the problem statement.

        ```
