Research Problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.

1. **Research Design and Methodology:**
   - Examine the research design and methodology used in the studies. Consider whether the methods are appropriate for the research question and if they are likely to produce reliable and valid results. Evaluate the sampling methods, data collection techniques, and data analysis methods used.

2. **Validity and Reliability:**
   - Assess the validity and reliability of the studies. Consider whether the findings are supported by the evidence presented and if the conclusions are justified. Examine whether the studies have been conducted in a rigorous and ethical manner.

3. **Bias and Conflict of Interest:**
   - Be aware of potential biases and conflicts of interest that may influence the findings of the studies. Consider the authors' affiliations, funding sources, and any potential conflicts of interest that may have influenced the research outcomes.

4. **Generalizability and Applicability:**
   - Evaluate the generalizability and applicability of the findings. Consider whether the results can be generalized to other populations, settings, or contexts. Assess the practical implications of the findings and their relevance to the research question.

5. **Currency and Significance:**
   - Consider the currency and significance of the studies. Are the studies up-to-date and relevant to the current state of knowledge in the field? Evaluate the impact and contribution of the studies to the body of knowledge in the field.

6. **Synthesis and Integration:**
   - Synthesize and integrate the findings of the studies to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in the literature. Consider how the studies complement or contradict each other and identify areas where further research is needed.

7. **Limitations and Strengths:**
   - Acknowledge the limitations and strengths of the studies. Identify areas where the studies could be improved and highlight the strengths that contribute to the overall understanding of the research topic.

By critically evaluating the literature, researchers can identify high-quality studies, assess the validity and reliability of the findings, and gain a deeper understanding of the research topic. This process helps to ensure that the literature review is comprehensive, accurate, and contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field.

}
Observation:
```
Reflection: Synthesizing and analyzing the findings of a literature review involves combining and interpreting the results of multiple studies to draw meaningful conclusions and identify patterns or trends. Here are several ways to synthesize and analyze the findings:

1. **Narrative Synthesis:**
   - This method involves summarizing and integrating the findings of individual studies into a coherent and comprehensive narrative.
   - The researcher presents the key findings, similarities, and differences among studies, and discusses their implications.
   - Narrative synthesis allows for a qualitative understanding of the research topic and provides a holistic perspective.

2. **Meta-Analysis:**
   - Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine the results of multiple studies that investigate the same research question.
   - It involves calculating an overall effect size and assessing the variability across studies.
   - Meta-analysis provides a quantitative summary of the findings and helps determine the overall strength and consistency of the evidence.

3. **Systematic Review:**
   - A systematic review is a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of all relevant studies on a specific topic.
   - It involves identifying, selecting, and critically appraising studies that meet predefined criteria.
   - The findings of the included studies are then synthesized and analyzed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research evidence.

4. **Thematic Analysis:**
   - Thematic analysis is a qualitative research method used to identify and interpret patterns and themes across a set of texts or data.
   - In a literature review, thematic analysis can be used to identify common themes or concepts that emerge from the findings of multiple studies.
   - This method helps to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the research literature.

5. **Grounded Theory:**
   - Grounded theory is an inductive research method that involves generating theory from data.
   - In a literature review, grounded theory can be used to develop new theoretical frameworks or models based on the findings of multiple studies.
   - This method allows for the emergence of new insights and understanding from the existing research.

6. **Meta-Synthesis:**
   - Meta-synthesis is a method that combines the findings of multiple qualitative studies to generate a new, overarching interpretation.
   - It involves synthesizing the findings of individual studies into a coherent and comprehensive narrative.
   - Meta-synthesis allows for a deeper understanding of the research topic and provides a more nuanced interpretation of the findings.

The choice of synthesis and analysis method depends on the research question, the type of studies included in the review, and the desired outcomes. By employing appropriate synthesis and analysis techniques, researchers can effectively integrate and interpret the findings of multiple studies, leading to a more comprehensive and meaningful understanding of the research topic.

 "things_to_reflect_on": "What are the different ways to write a literature review?"
}
Observation:
```
Reflection: There are several different ways to write a literature review, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The most common type of literature review is the narrative review, which provides a summary and synthesis of the existing research on a particular topic. Narrative reviews are often used to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on a topic, or to identify gaps in the research.

Another common type of literature review is the systematic review, which is a more rigorous and structured approach to reviewing the literature. Systematic reviews typically involve a comprehensive search of the literature, followed by a critical appraisal of the studies that are included in the review. The results of a systematic review are typically presented in a meta-analysis, which is a statistical analysis of the results of multiple studies.

A third type of literature review is the meta-synthesis, which is a qualitative approach to reviewing the literature. Meta-syntheses typically involve a thematic analysis of the findings of multiple studies, with the goal of identifying common themes and patterns. Meta-syntheses are often used to develop new theories or models, or to identify new directions for research.

Finally, a fourth type of literature review is the scoping review, which is a relatively new approach to reviewing the literature. Scoping reviews are typically used to map the existing research on a particular topic, and to identify gaps in the research. Scoping reviews are often used to inform the development of research agendas or to identify areas for future research.

The best type of literature review for a particular project will depend on the specific research question and the available resources. In some cases, a narrative review may be sufficient, while in other cases a more rigorous systematic review or meta-synthesis may be necessary.
