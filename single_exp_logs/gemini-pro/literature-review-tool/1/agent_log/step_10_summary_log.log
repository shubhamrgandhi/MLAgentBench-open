Action:  Final Answer
Action Input:  {
 "final_answer": "I have created a literature review tool that can generate reports on a given research topic. The tool uses the arXiv API to get related papers, summarizes them using a large language model (LLM), and generates a report with the list of papers, summaries, and a conclusion."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        end
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
