Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The current directory contains four files and one directory: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem statement and the tools available. Done.
2. Come up with a high level plan. Done.
3. Start implementing the plan.
4. Implement the first step of the plan.








Fact Check:    
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Guessed: I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
3. Confirmed: Understand the problem statement and the tools available.
4. Confirmed: Come up with a high level plan.
5. Guessed: Implement the first step of the plan.
Thought:    The first step of the plan is to define the research question or topic. I should do that now.
Action:    Reflection
Action Input:    {
 "things_to_reflect_on": "What is the research question or topic?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: The research question or topic is to create a literature review tool that can be used to generate a report on a given research topic. The tool should be able to:

* Call the arXiv API to get a list of related papers.
* Use a large language model (LLM) to summarize these papers.
* Generate a report that includes the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.

The tool should be easy to use and should be able to generate high-quality reports. It should also be able to handle a variety of research topics.

The research plan is to first understand the problem statement and the tools available. Then, a high-level plan will be developed. Finally, the plan will be implemented and the tool will be evaluated.

The expected outcome of the research is a literature review tool that can be used by researchers to quickly and easily generate high-quality reports on a variety of research topics.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
