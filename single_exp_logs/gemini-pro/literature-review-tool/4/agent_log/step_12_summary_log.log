Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The current directory contains the following files: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log. I can proceed with the task.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.
7. Install the 'arxiv' module.
8. Run the system again.












Fact Check:    
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Confirmed: A new Python script file named "literature_review.py" was created.
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
4. Confirmed: The function get_arxiv_data is added to the file literature_review.py.
5. Confirmed: The function summarize_paper is added to the file literature_review.py.
6. Confirmed: The function generate_report is added to the file literature_review.py.
7. Confirmed: The current directory contains the following files: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.
Thought:     I should install the 'arxiv' module.
Action:     Copy File
Action Input:    
{
 "source": "claude_example.py",
 "destination": "arxiv.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        File claude_example.py copied to arxiv.py
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The 'arxiv' module is not installed, so the system cannot run.
[Action]: Copied the file 'claude_example.py' to 'arxiv.py'.
[Observation]: The file 'claude_example.py' was copied to 'arxiv.py'.
