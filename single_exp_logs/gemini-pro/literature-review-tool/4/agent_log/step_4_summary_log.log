===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The file literature_review.py is created. I can proceed with the task.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.








Fact Check:    
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. **Confirmed: A new Python script file named "literature_review.py" was created.**
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
Thought:    I should implement the function to call arxiv API.
Action:    Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:    {
 "script_name": "literature_review.py",
 "start_line_number": 1,
 "end_line_number": 32
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 32):

# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('literature_review.csv')

# Clean the data
df = df.dropna()
df['Year'] = df['Year'].astype(int)

# Create a new column for the decade
df['Decade'] = df['Year'].apply(lambda x: x // 10 * 10)

# Group the data by decade and count the number of studies
df_decades = df.groupby('Decade').size().reset_index(name='Count')

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Decade', y='Count', data=df_decades)
plt.title('Number of Studies Published by Decade')
plt.xlabel('Decade')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()

# Calculate the average number of studies per year
avg_studies_per_year = df['Year'].count() / df['Decade'].nunique()

# Print the average number of studies per year
print('Average number of studies published per year:', avg_studies_per_year)
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py to understand the purpose of the script and the functions it contains.

[Action]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py from line 1 to line 32.

[Observation]: The observation is that the script literature_review.py is a Python script that imports the necessary libraries, loads and cleans the data, creates a new column for the decade, groups the data by decade and counts the number of studies, plots the data, calculates the average number of studies per year, and prints the average number of studies per year.
