===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.


Fact Check:  
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Guessed: I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Thought:  I should first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
 "file_name": "arxiv_API_reference.txt",
 "things_to_look_for": "How to use arxiv API to get a list of related papers."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/4\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand how to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" to find the information.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/4\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt".
