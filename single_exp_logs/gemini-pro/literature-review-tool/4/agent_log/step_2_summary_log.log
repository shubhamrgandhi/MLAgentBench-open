===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory. I can proceed with the task.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.






Fact Check:    
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Guessed: I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
Thought:    I should understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Action:    Understand File
Action Input:    {
 "file_name": "literature_review.py",
 "things_to_look_for": "The overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented."
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        In this segment, I cannot find the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The input to the action is a dictionary with two keys: "file_name" and "things_to_look_for". The value of "file_name" is "literature_review.py" and the value of "things_to_look_for" is "The overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented.".
[Observation]: The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.
