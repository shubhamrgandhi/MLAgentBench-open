Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The file arxiv_API_reference.txt does not exist. I cannot proceed with the task.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.




Fact Check:   
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Guessed: I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
