===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The script execution failed due to a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'claude_api_key'. I need to create the file 'claude_api_key.py' and put the API key in it before I can proceed.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.
7. Install the 'arxiv' module.
8. Run the system again.
9. Create the file 'claude_api_key.txt' and put the API key in it.
10. Run the system again.
11. Add the necessary imports for the Anthropic API key and client.
12. Run the system again.
13. Create the file 'claude_api_key.py' and put the API key in it.
14. Run the system again.










Fact Check:       
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Confirmed: A new Python script file named "literature_review.py" was created.
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
4. Confirmed: The function get_arxiv_data is added to the file literature_review.py.
5. Confirmed: The function summarize_paper is added to the file literature_review.py.
6. Confirmed: The function generate_report is added to the file literature_review.py.
7. Confirmed: The current directory contains the following files: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.
8. Confirmed: The file 'claude_example.py' was copied to 'arxiv.py'.
9. Confirmed: The script execution failed due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'claude_api_key.txt'.
10. Confirmed: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py.
11. Confirmed: The script execution failed due to a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'claude_api_key'.
Thought:       I should create the file 'claude_api_key.py' and put the API key in it.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed due to a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'claude_api_key'. I need to import the 'claude_api_key' module before I can use the 'client' variable.
[Action]: I added the following line to the beginning of the script:

```
import claude_api_key
```

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py.
