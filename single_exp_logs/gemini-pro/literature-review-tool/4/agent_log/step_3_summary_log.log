Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The file literature_review.py does not contain the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented. I cannot proceed with the task.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.






Fact Check:   
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Guessed: I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
Thought:   I need to create a literature_review.py file.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
 "script_name": "literature_review.py",
 "edit_instruction": "Create a new Python script file named literature_review.py.",

        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The literature_review.py file does not exist, so it needs to be created.
[Action]: Created a new Python script file named literature_review.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the file contains code for loading, cleaning, and plotting data related to studies published by decade.
