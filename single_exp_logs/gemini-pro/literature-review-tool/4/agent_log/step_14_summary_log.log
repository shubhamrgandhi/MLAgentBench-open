===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script execution failed due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'claude_api_key.txt'. I need to create the file 'claude_api_key.txt' and put the API key in it before I can proceed.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.
7. Install the 'arxiv' module.
8. Run the system again.
9. Create the file 'claude_api_key.txt' and put the API key in it.
10. Run the system again.








Fact Check:      
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Confirmed: A new Python script file named "literature_review.py" was created.
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
4. Confirmed: The function get_arxiv_data is added to the file literature_review.py.
5. Confirmed: The function summarize_paper is added to the file literature_review.py.
6. Confirmed: The function generate_report is added to the file literature_review.py.
7. Confirmed: The current directory contains the following files: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.
8. Confirmed: The file 'claude_example.py' was copied to 'arxiv.py'.
9. Confirmed: The script execution failed due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'claude_api_key.txt'.
Thought:      I should create the file 'claude_api_key.txt' and put the API key in it.

[Reasoning]: The script execution failed due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'claude_api_key.txt'. I need to create the file 'claude_api_key.txt' and put the API key in it before I can proceed.
[Action]: Edited the script "literature_review.py" by adding the following line to the beginning of the script:

```
from claude_api_key import API_KEY
client = anthropic.Client(API_KEY)
```

Saved the edited file as "literature_review.py".
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff is shown, which includes the added line.
