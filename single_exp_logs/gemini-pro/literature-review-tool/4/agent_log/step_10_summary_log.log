Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The function to generate a report is added to the file literature_review.py. I can proceed with the task.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
2. Create a literature_review.py file.
3. Implement the function to call arxiv API.
4. Implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
5. Implement the function to generate a report.
6. Test the system.










Fact Check:   
1. Guessed: This is the first time I am seeing this problem.
2. Confirmed: A new Python script file named "literature_review.py" was created.
3. Confirmed: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.
4. Confirmed: The function get_arxiv_data is added to the file literature_review.py.
5. Confirmed: The function summarize_paper is added to the file literature_review.py.
6. Confirmed: The function generate_report is added to the file literature_review.py.
Thought:    I should test the system.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:   
{
 "script_name": "literature_review.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\2671148\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\literature-review-tool\4\literature-review-tool\literature_review.py", line 6, in <module>
    from arxiv import Arxiv
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arxiv'

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script execution failed due to a missing module called 'arxiv'.
[Action]: The script literature_review.py was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution failed with the error message "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arxiv'".
