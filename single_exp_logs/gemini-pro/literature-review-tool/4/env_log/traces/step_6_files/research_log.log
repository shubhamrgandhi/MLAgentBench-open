Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand how to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" to find the information.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/4\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is needed to proceed with the task.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The input to the action is a dictionary with two keys: "file_name" and "things_to_look_for". The value of "file_name" is "literature_review.py" and the value of "things_to_look_for" is "The overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented.".
[Observation]: The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.
