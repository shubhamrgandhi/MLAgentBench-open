The diff shows that the file contains code for loading, cleaning, and plotting data related to studies published by decade.\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n[Reasoning]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py to understand the purpose of the script and the functions it contains.\n\n[Action]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py from line 1 to line 32.\n\n[Observation]: The observation is that the script literature_review.py is a Python script that imports the necessary libraries, loads and cleans the data, creates a new column for the decade, groups the data by decade and counts the number of studies, plots the data, calculates the average number of studies per year, and prints the average number of studies per year.\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n[Reasoning]: The function to call arxiv API is not implemented in the file literature_review.py.\n[Action]: Edited the file literature_review.py to implement the function to call arxiv API.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the function get_arxiv_data is added to the file.\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n[Reasoning]: The function get_arxiv_data is added to the file literature_review.py. The next step is to implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers. To do this, it is necessary to inspect the script lines to see if there is any existing code that can be used or modified.\n[Action]: Inspected the script lines from line 1 to line 55 in the file literature_review.py.\n[Observation]: The script lines contain code for loading and cleaning data, creating visualizations, and calling the arXiv API to get data on articles published in the last 10 years. There is no existing code that can be used or modified to implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.\n\n\n\nStep 7:\n[Reasoning]: The function to use LLM to summarize papers is not implemented in the file literature_review.py. I need to implement this function in order to proceed with the task.\n[Action]: I edited the script literature_review.py and added the function summarize_paper to it. This function uses the LLM model \"google/pegasus-xsum\" to summarize paper text.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the function summarize_paper is added to the file. The function takes paper text as input and returns a summary of the paper. The function uses the LLM model \"google/pegasus-xsum\" to generate the summary.\n\n\n\nStep 8:\n[Reasoning]: The system has already implemented the function to call the arXiv API and the function to use LLM to summarize papers. The next step is to implement the function to generate a report.\n[Action]: The system inspected the script lines of literature_review.py from line 1 to line 75.\n[Observation]: The system found that the function to generate a report is not implemented yet.\n\n\n\nStep 9:\n[Reasoning]: The function to generate a report is not implemented in the file literature_review.py.\n[Action]: Edited the script literature_review.py to implement the function generate_report. The function takes three arguments: df, df_arxiv, and avg_studies_per_year. It creates a report string that includes an introduction, data, findings, conclusion, and recommendations. The report string is then returned.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows the changes made to the file. The function generate_report is added to the file. The function is called with the arguments df, df_arxiv, and avg_studies_per_year. The report string is printed.\n\n\n\nStep 10:\n[Reasoning]: The script execution failed due to a missing module called 'arxiv'.\n[Action]: The script literature_review.py was executed.\n[Observation]: The script execution failed with the error message \"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arxiv'\".\n\n\n\nStep 11:\n[Reasoning]: I need to install the 'arxiv' module to proceed with the script execution.\n[Action]: I listed the files in the current directory.\n[Observation]: The current directory contains the following files: arxiv_API_reference.txt, backup/, claude_example.py, literature_review.py, and research_log.log.\n\n\n\nStep 12:\n[Reasoning]: The 'arxiv' module is not installed, so the system cannot run.\n[Action]: Copied the file 'claude_example.py' to 'arxiv.py'.\n[Observation]: The file 'claude_example.py' was copied to 'arxiv.py'.\n\n\n\nStep 13:\n[Reasoning]: The script literature_review.py was executed to test the system.\n\n[Action]: The script literature_review.py was executed.\n\n[Observation]: The script failed to run due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'claude_api_key.txt'.\n\n",
