===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand how to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" to find the information.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/4\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is needed to proceed with the task.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The input to the action is a dictionary with two keys: "file_name" and "things_to_look_for". The value of "file_name" is "literature_review.py" and the value of "things_to_look_for" is "The overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented.".
[Observation]: The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The literature_review.py file does not exist, so it needs to be created.
[Action]: Created a new Python script file named literature_review.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the file contains code for loading, cleaning, and plotting data related to studies published by decade.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py to understand the purpose of the script and the functions it contains.

[Action]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py from line 1 to line 32.

[Observation]: The observation is that the script literature_review.py is a Python script that imports the necessary libraries, loads and cleans the data, creates a new column for the decade, groups the data by decade and counts the number of studies, plots the data, calculates the average number of studies per year, and prints the average number of studies per year.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The function to call arxiv API is not implemented in the file literature_review.py.
[Action]: Edited the file literature_review.py to implement the function to call arxiv API.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the function get_arxiv_data is added to the file.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The function get_arxiv_data is added to the file literature_review.py. The next step is to implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers. To do this, it is necessary to inspect the script lines to see if there is any existing code that can be used or modified.
[Action]: Inspected the script lines from line 1 to line 55 in the file literature_review.py.
[Observation]: The script lines contain code for loading and cleaning data, creating visualizations, and calling the arXiv API to get data on articles published in the last 10 years. There is no existing code that can be used or modified to implement the function to use LLM to summarize papers.
