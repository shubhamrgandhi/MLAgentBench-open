===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand how to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" to find the information.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/4\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is needed to proceed with the task.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt exists in the current directory.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file literature_review.py. The input to the action is a dictionary with two keys: "file_name" and "things_to_look_for". The value of "file_name" is "literature_review.py" and the value of "things_to_look_for" is "The overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented.".
[Observation]: The observation is that the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented cannot be found in this segment.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The literature_review.py file does not exist, so it needs to be created.
[Action]: Created a new Python script file named literature_review.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the file contains code for loading, cleaning, and plotting data related to studies published by decade.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py to understand the purpose of the script and the functions it contains.

[Action]: The action is to inspect the lines of the script literature_review.py from line 1 to line 32.

[Observation]: The observation is that the script literature_review.py is a Python script that imports the necessary libraries, loads and cleans the data, creates a new column for the decade, groups the data by decade and counts the number of studies, plots the data, calculates the average number of studies per year, and prints the average number of studies per year.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The agent encountered an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/4\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt" while trying to read the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt".
- The file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" exists in the current directory.
- The agent was unable to find the overall structure of the program and the functions that need to be implemented in the file "literature_review.py".
- The agent created a new Python script file named "literature_review.py".
- The agent inspected the lines of the script "literature_review.py" from line 1 to line 32 and observed that the script imports the necessary libraries, loads and cleans the data, creates a new column for the decade, groups the data by decade and counts the number of studies, plots the data, calculates the average number of studies per year, and prints the average number of studies per year.
