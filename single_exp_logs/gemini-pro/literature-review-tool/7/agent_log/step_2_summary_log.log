===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The edit instruction is not correct. It should be "Create a new python script file with the name literature_review.py.".
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem:
    - Read the problem statement carefully.
    - Identify the key requirements and constraints.
    - Research on the relevant concepts and technologies.
2. Design a high level plan:
    - Use arxiv API to retrieve relevant papers.
    - Use LLM to summarize the papers and generate a report.
    - The report should include the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.
3. Implement the plan:
    - Create a python script literature_review.py.
    - Write code to call the arxiv API and LLM.
    - Test the script and make sure it works correctly.
4. Evaluate the results:
    - Manually check the quality of the generated report.
    - Compare the results with the baseline performance.
5. Finalize the solution:
    - Refine the script based on the evaluation results.
    - Write a clear and concise final answer.




Fact Check:    
* **Create a new python script file with the name literature_review.py.**
    - Guessed.

Thought:    I should create a python script literature_review.py first.
