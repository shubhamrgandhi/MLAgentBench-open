===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit is correct and desirable. The code to call the arxiv API and LLM has been added to the end of the literature_review.py script.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem:
    - Read the problem statement carefully.
    - Identify the key requirements and constraints.
    - Research on the relevant concepts and technologies.
2. Design a high level plan:
    - Use arxiv API to retrieve relevant papers.
    - Use LLM to summarize the papers and generate a report.
    - The report should include the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.
3. Implement the plan:
    - Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.
4. Evaluate the results:
    - Manually check the quality of the generated report.
    - Compare the results with the baseline performance.
5. Finalize the solution:
    - Refine the script based on the evaluation results.
    - Write a clear and concise final answer.








Fact Check:     
* **Create a new python script file with the name literature_review.py.**
    - Guessed.
* **Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.**
    - Guessed.
* **Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.**
    - Guessed.

Thought:     I should test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "literature_review.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
