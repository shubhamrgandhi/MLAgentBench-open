Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script fails to run due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'literature_review.csv'.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem:
    - Read the problem statement carefully.
    - Identify the key requirements and constraints.
    - Research on the relevant concepts and technologies.
2. Design a high level plan:
    - Use arxiv API to retrieve relevant papers.
    - Use LLM to summarize the papers and generate a report.
    - The report should include the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.
3. Implement the plan:
    - Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.
    - Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.
4. Evaluate the results:
    - Manually check the quality of the generated report.
    - Compare the results with the baseline performance.
5. Finalize the solution:
    - Refine the script based on the evaluation results.
    - Write a clear and concise final answer.








Fact Check:      
* **Create a new python script file with the name literature_review.py.**
    - Guessed.
* **Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.**
    - Guessed.
* **Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.**
    - Guessed.

Thought:      I should fix the FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'literature_review.csv' error.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script fails to run due to a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'literature_review.csv'. To fix this error, a new CSV file named 'literature_review.csv' needs to be created.
[Action]: Add the following code to the beginning of the literature_review.py script:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame()
df.to_csv('literature_review.csv', index=False)
```

This code imports the Pandas library, creates an empty DataFrame, and saves it to a CSV file named 'literature_review.csv'.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the code to create the CSV file is added to the beginning of the script.
