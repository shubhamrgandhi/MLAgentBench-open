Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:        The script fails to run due to a NameError: name 'pd' is not defined. Did you mean: 'id'? error. This is because the pandas library is not imported in the script.
Research Plan and Status:        
1. Understand the problem:
    - Read the problem statement carefully.
    - Identify the key requirements and constraints.
    - Research on the relevant concepts and technologies.
2. Design a high level plan:
    - Use arxiv API to retrieve relevant papers.
    - Use LLM to summarize the papers and generate a report.
    - The report should include the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.
3. Implement the plan:
    - Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.
    - Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.
4. Evaluate the results:
    - Manually check the quality of the generated report.
    - Compare the results with the baseline performance.
5. Finalize the solution:
    - Refine the script based on the evaluation results.
    - Write a clear and concise final answer.












Fact Check:        
* **Create a new python script file with the name literature_review.py.**
    - Guessed.
* **Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.**
    - Guessed.
* **Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.**
    - Guessed.
* **Create a new CSV file named 'literature_review.csv'.**
    - Guessed.
* **Add the following code to the beginning of the literature_review.py script:```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\ndf.to_csv('literature_review.csv', index=False)\n```**
    - Guessed.
* **Add the following code to the beginning of the literature_review.py script:```python\ntry:\n    df = pd.read_csv('literature_review.csv')\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    df = pd.DataFrame()\ndf.to_csv('literature_review.csv', index=False)\n```**
    - Guessed.
* **Import the pandas library in the literature_review.py script.**
    - Guessed.

Thought:        I should import the pandas library in the literature_review.py script.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script fails to run due to a NameError: name 'pd' is not defined. Did you mean: 'id'? error. This is because the pandas library is not imported in the script.
[Action]: Add the following line to the beginning of the literature_review.py script:

```python
import pandas as pd
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the line `import pandas as pd` is added to the beginning of the file.
