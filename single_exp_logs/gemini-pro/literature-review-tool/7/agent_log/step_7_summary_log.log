Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The script fails to run due to a pandas.errors.EmptyDataError: No columns to parse from file error. This is because the 'literature_review.csv' file is empty.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the problem:
    - Read the problem statement carefully.
    - Identify the key requirements and constraints.
    - Research on the relevant concepts and technologies.
2. Design a high level plan:
    - Use arxiv API to retrieve relevant papers.
    - Use LLM to summarize the papers and generate a report.
    - The report should include the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.
3. Implement the plan:
    - Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.
    - Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.
4. Evaluate the results:
    - Manually check the quality of the generated report.
    - Compare the results with the baseline performance.
5. Finalize the solution:
    - Refine the script based on the evaluation results.
    - Write a clear and concise final answer.










Fact Check:       
* **Create a new python script file with the name literature_review.py.**
    - Guessed.
* **Write code in literature_review.py to call the arxiv API and LLM.**
    - Guessed.
* **Test the script literature_review.py and make sure it works correctly.**
    - Guessed.
* **Create a new CSV file named 'literature_review.csv'.**
    - Guessed.
* **Add the following code to the beginning of the literature_review.py script:```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\ndf.to_csv('literature_review.csv', index=False)\n```**
    - Guessed.

Thought:       I should add some code to the literature_review.py script to handle the case when the 'literature_review.csv' file is empty.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script fails to run due to a pandas.errors.EmptyDataError: No columns to parse from file error. This is because the 'literature_review.csv' file is empty. To fix this, we can add code to the beginning of the script to check if the file exists. If it does not exist, we can create an empty DataFrame and save it to the file.
[Action]: Add the following code to the beginning of the literature_review.py script:

```python
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('literature_review.csv')
except FileNotFoundError:
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df.to_csv('literature_review.csv', index=False)
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to literature_review.py. The diff shows that the code was added to the beginning of the file.
