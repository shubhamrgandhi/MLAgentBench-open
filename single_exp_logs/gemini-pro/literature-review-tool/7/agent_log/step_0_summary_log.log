===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am exposed to this problem. I need to understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem:
    - Read the problem statement carefully.
    - Identify the key requirements and constraints.
    - Research on the relevant concepts and technologies.
2. Design a high level plan:
    - Use arxiv API to retrieve relevant papers.
    - Use LLM to summarize the papers and generate a report.
    - The report should include the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.
3. Implement the plan:
    - Write a python script to call the arxiv API and LLM.
    - Test the script and make sure it works correctly.
4. Evaluate the results:
    - Manually check the quality of the generated report.
    - Compare the results with the baseline performance.
5. Finalize the solution:
    - Refine the script based on the evaluation results.
    - Write a clear and concise final answer.


Fact Check:  No objective statements in this step.
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem statement carefully.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "literature_review.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "The overall structure of the script and the functions defined in it."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        In this segment, I cannot find the overall structure of the script and the functions defined in it.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
