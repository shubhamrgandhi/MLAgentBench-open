===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation does not contain the answer to whether the file "research_log.log" is readable. This means that I need to try a different approach to determine if the file is readable.

Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem statement and the available tools.
2. Come up with a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Start implementing the plan.
4. Investigate why the error "EnvError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'research_log.log'" is occurring, even though the file is readable.
5. Try to read the file "research_log.log" using the open() function.





Fact Check:    
* The file "research_log.log" exists in the current directory. (Confirmed by List Files action)
* The file "research_log.log" is readable. (Confirmed by Copy File action)

Thought:    I should try to open the file "research_log.log" in read mode. If the file is readable, this operation should succeed.

Action:    Copy File
Action Input:    
```
{
 "source": "research_log.log",
 "destination": "research_log_copy.log"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        File research_log.log copied to research_log_copy.log
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
