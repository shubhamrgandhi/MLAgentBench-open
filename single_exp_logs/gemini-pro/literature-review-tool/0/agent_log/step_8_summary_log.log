===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation does not contain the answer to whether the file "research_log.log" is readable. This means that I need to try a different approach to determine if the file is readable.

Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem statement and the available tools.
2. Come up with a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Start implementing the plan.







Fact Check:   

Thought:   I should try to open the file "research_log.log" in read mode. If the file is readable, this operation should succeed.

Action:   Copy File
Action Input:   
```
{
 "source": "research_log.log",
 "destination": "research_log_copy.log"
}
```
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        File research_log.log copied to research_log_copy.log
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
