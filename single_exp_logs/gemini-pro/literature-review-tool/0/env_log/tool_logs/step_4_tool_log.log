We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.
    Your current research log:
    ```
    

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to read a file but is unable to do so.
[Action]: The agent is trying to read a file named "research_log.log" from the path "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/0\literature-review-tool".
[Observation]: The agent is unable to read the file and receives an "EnvError".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The research_log.log file is not found. It is necessary to check if the file exists before trying to read it.
[Action]: Listed files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The research_log.log file exists in the current directory.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
The research team has encountered an issue while attempting to create a literature review system using a large language model (LLM). The system is designed to access the Anthropic API with an API key stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt." The team has also included an example script called "claude_example.py" to demonstrate how to use the API.

The system is intended to perform the following tasks:

1. Given a research topic, it should query the arXiv API using appropriate queries to retrieve a list of relevant papers.
2. It should then utilize the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report.
3. The report should include the list of papers, a summary of each paper, and a conclusion of the literature review.

However, the team encountered an error when trying to read the research log file named "research_log.log" from the specified path. The error message indicates an "EnvError," suggesting that the file could not be found or accessed.

To address this issue, the team took the following steps:

1. They checked if the research_log.log file existed in the current directory.
2. They confirmed that the file was indeed present in the directory.

Despite this, the error persisted, indicating that there might be an underlying issue with the file path or permissions. The team needs to further investigate the cause of the error and resolve it to proceed with the development of the literature review system.
