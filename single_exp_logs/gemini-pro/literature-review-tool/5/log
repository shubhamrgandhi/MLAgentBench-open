=====================================
Benchmark folder name:  literature-review-tool
Research problem:  Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 1
Reflection: The error is caused by the fact that the file path is not a valid file name with relative path to current directory.
```
workspaces/single_exp_``` is not a valid file name with relative path to current directory.
```
```
5\``` is not a valid file name with relative path to current directory.
```

Plan and Status:
1. xtick the problem.
**2. Come up with a high level plan.**
3. **Read the problem statement carefully.**

Check:
**2. Come up with a high level plan.**

Thought: I should use the following high level plan to solve the problem:
1. Call arxiv API with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
2. Use the LLM to summarize these papers.
3. Generate a report that includes the list of papers, the summary of each paper, and the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 7
Reflection: The error message indicates that the directory `workspaces/single` does not exist.

Research Plan and Status:

* Understand the problem:
    * The goal is to create a literature review tool based on a large language model (LLM).
    * The LLM will be accessed using the Anthropic API with the API key stored in `claude_api_key.txt`.
    * The tool should be able to:
        * Call the arXiv API to retrieve a list of related papers for a given query.
        * Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report.
        * The report should include:
            * The list of papers.
            * The summary of each paper.
            * The conclusion of the literature review.
* Come up with a high level plan:
    * Create a new directory for the project.
    * Install the necessary Python packages.
    * Write a Python script to call the arXiv API and retrieve a list of related papers for a given query.
    * Write a Python script to use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report.
    * Test the tool on a few sample queries.



Fact Check:

* The statement "The directory `workspaces/single` does not exist" is directly confirmed by the observation.

Thought: I should create a new directory for the project.

Action: Create Directory
