We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem by reading the problem statement carefully.
[Action]: The agent reflects on what the problem is asking it to do.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message indicating that it cannot read a file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action was taken to check if the file research_log.log exists.
[Action]: The action taken was to list files in the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/5\literature-review-tool.
[Observation]: The observation was that the action failed with the error message "EnvError: Cannot list file in the workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/5\literature-review-tool directory".



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to determine if the directory `workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/5\literature-review-tool` exists.
[Action]: The agent reflects on the provided research log to check if the directory exists.
[Observation]: The agent is unable to determine whether the directory exists or not based on the provided research log. The error message indicates that the system was unable to list the files in the specified directory, but it does not provide a definitive answer as to why.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to check if the file research_log.log exists.
[Action]: The agent tries to list files in the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/-pro/literature-review-tool/5\literature-review-tool.
[Observation]: The agent fails to list files in the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/-pro/literature-review-tool/5\literature-review-tool.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The directory `workspaces/single/exp/logs/gemini/pro/literature_review_tool` does not exist, so listing files in it will result in an error.
[Action]: List files in the directory `workspaces/single/exp/logs/gemini/pro/literature_review_tool`.
[Observation]: The action resulted in an `EnvError` with the message `Cannot list file in the workspaces\/single\/exp\/logs\/gemini\/pro\/literature_review_tool directory`.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The directory `workspaces/single/exp/logs/gemini/pro` does not exist, so listing files in it will result in an error.
[Action]: List files in the directory `workspaces/single/exp/logs/gemini/pro`.
[Observation]: The action resulted in an `EnvError` with the message `Cannot list file in the workspaces\/single\/exp\/logs\/gemini\/pro directory`.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:
