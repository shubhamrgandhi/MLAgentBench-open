===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and available tools.
[Action]: The agent lists the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The agent observes the following files in the current directory:
- arxiv_API_reference.txt
- backup/
- claude_example.py
- literature_review.py



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" to learn how to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is that the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" cannot be read.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is needed, but it cannot be found. Listing files in the backup directory may help locate the file.
[Action]: List files in the backup directory.
[Observation]: The observation is not available.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The backup directory is empty, so the file arxiv_API_reference.txt is not in the backup directory. I need to list all files in the current directory to see if the file is there.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is in the current directory.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand the arxiv API by reading the file arxiv_API_reference.txt.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file arxiv_API_reference.txt.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/6\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt".



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The agent cannot read the file arxiv_API_reference.txt, so it needs to find another way to understand the arxiv API.
[Action]: The agent lists files in the backup directory.
[Observation]: The observation is not provided.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The backup directory is empty, so I cannot find the file arxiv_API_reference.txt there. I need to list all files in the current directory to see if the file is there.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is listed in the current directory.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The goal is to create an AI system for literature review using a large language model (LLM) and the arxiv API.
- The LLM can be accessed using the Anthropic API with an API key stored in claude_api_key.txt.
- The system should take a research topic as input, retrieve related papers from the arxiv API, summarize the papers using the LLM, and generate a report.
- The report should include a list of papers, a summary of each paper, and a conclusion of the literature review.
- The agent is unable to read the file arxiv_API_reference.txt, which contains information on how to use the arxiv API.
- The agent has tried listing files in the current directory and the backup directory, but the file cannot be found.
