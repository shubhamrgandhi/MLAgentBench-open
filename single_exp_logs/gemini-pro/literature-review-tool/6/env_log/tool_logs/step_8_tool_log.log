===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and available tools.
[Action]: The agent lists the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The agent observes the following files in the current directory:
- arxiv_API_reference.txt
- backup/
- claude_example.py
- literature_review.py



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" to learn how to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is that the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" cannot be read.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is needed, but it cannot be found. Listing files in the backup directory may help locate the file.
[Action]: List files in the backup directory.
[Observation]: The observation is not available.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The backup directory is empty, so the file arxiv_API_reference.txt is not in the backup directory. I need to list all files in the current directory to see if the file is there.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is in the current directory.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The research aims to create an AI system for literature review using a large language model (LLM) and the arxiv API.
- The LLM will be used to summarize research papers and generate a report, including a list of papers, summaries, and a conclusion.
- The arxiv API will be used to retrieve a list of related papers for a given research topic.
- The current challenge is that the file "arxiv_API_reference.txt", which contains instructions on how to use the arxiv API, is missing.
- The file "arxiv_API_reference.txt" was found in the current directory after listing all files.
