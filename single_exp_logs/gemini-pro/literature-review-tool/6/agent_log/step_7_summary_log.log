===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:  1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan.
3. Implement the plan.
4. Test and evaluate the system.
5. Submit the final answer.


Fact Check:  **1. The file arxiv_API_reference.txt is in the current directory. (directly confirmed)**
Thought:  I can now understand the arxiv API.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "arxiv_API_reference.txt",
    "things_to_look_for": "How to use the arxiv API to get a list of related papers."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/literature-review-tool/6\literature-review-tool\arxiv_API_reference.txt
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
