===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am working on this problem. I need to come up with a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan.
3. Implement the plan.
4. Test and evaluate the system.
5. Submit the final answer.


Fact Check:  
1. This is the first time I am working on this problem. (guessed)
2. I need to come up with a high level plan. (guessed)
Thought:  I should first understand the problem and available tools.
Action:  List Files
