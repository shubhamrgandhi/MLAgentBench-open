Given this (partial) file from line 1 character 0 to line 11 character 334: 
    ``` 
    import os
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client(open("claude_api_key.txt").read().strip())
response = client.completion(
    prompt=f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} How many toes do dogs have?{anthropic.AI_PROMPT}",
    stop_sequences = [anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT],
    model="claude-v1",
    max_tokens_to_sample=100,
)
print(response)
    ```
    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How to use the anthropic API to generate text.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. (Line 2)
- It imports the necessary libraries, including the anthropic library. (Lines 1-2)
- It reads the API key from a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and creates a client object. (Lines 4-5)
- It sends a completion request to the API, specifying the prompt, stop sequences, model, and maximum number of tokens to sample. (Lines 7-10)
- The prompt includes both a human prompt and an AI prompt, separated by the anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT and anthropic.AI_PROMPT constants. (Line 8)
- The stop sequences are set to include only the human prompt, which means that the AI will stop generating text when it encounters the human prompt. (Line 9)
- The model specified is "claude-v1". (Line 10)
- The maximum number of tokens to sample is set to 100. (Line 10)
- The response from the API is printed to the console. (Line 11)

In this segment, I cannot find:
- What the specific prompt is.
- What the specific response from the API is.
===================tokens=====================
Number of prompt tokens: 239
Number of sampled tokens: 269
