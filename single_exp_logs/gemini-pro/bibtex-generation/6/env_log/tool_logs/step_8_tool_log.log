===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
[Action]: The agent lists all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The agent observes the following files in the current directory:
- arxiv_API_reference.txt
- backup/
- bibtex_generation.py
- claude_example.py
- google_scholar_API_reference.txt



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to use the anthropic API to generate text. The file claude_example.py provides an example of how to use the API.
[Action]: Read the file claude_example.py and look for information on how to use the anthropic API to generate text.
[Observation]:
- The script uses the anthropic API to generate text.
- It imports the necessary libraries, including the anthropic library.
- It reads the API key from a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and creates a client object.
- It sends a completion request to the API, specifying the prompt, stop sequences, model, and maximum number of tokens to sample.
- The prompt includes both a human prompt and an AI prompt, separated by the anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT and anthropic.AI_PROMPT constants.
- The stop sequences are set to include only the human prompt, which means that the AI will stop generating text when it encounters the human prompt.
- The model specified is "claude-v1".
- The maximum number of tokens to sample is set to 100.
- The response from the API is printed to the console.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand a file named "google_scholar_API_reference.txt" to learn how to use the Google Scholar API to search for papers and get BibTeX entries.
[Action]: The action is to read and understand the contents of the file "google_scholar_API_reference.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is that the provided context does not contain any information about how to use the Google Scholar API to search for papers and get BibTeX entries. Therefore, the requested data cannot be extracted from the provided context.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to use the arxiv API to search for papers and get bibtex entries. The action is to understand the arxiv_API_reference.txt file.
[Action]: The action is to understand the arxiv_API_reference.txt file.
[Observation]: The observation is that the file arxiv_API_reference.txt cannot be read.
