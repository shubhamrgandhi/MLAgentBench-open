            "observation": "Reflection: There are several challenges in learning more about LLM, Google Scholar API, and BibTeX entries:\n\n**LLM:**\n\n* **Technical Complexity:** LLMs are complex AI models that require specialized knowledge and expertise to understand and use effectively. This can make it difficult for individuals without a technical background to learn about and implement LLMs.\n\n* **Limited Resources:** Access to powerful computing resources and large datasets is often necessary for training and deploying LLMs. These resources can be expensive and difficult to obtain, especially for individuals or small organizations.\n\n* **Ethical Considerations:** The use of LLMs raises ethical concerns related to bias, privacy, and the potential for misuse. Understanding and addressing these ethical implications is crucial for responsible development and deployment of LLMs.\n\n**Google Scholar API:**\n\n* **Documentation and Accessibility:** The documentation for the Google Scholar API may not be comprehensive or user-friendly, making it challenging for developers to understand and integrate the API into their applications.\n\n* **Authentication and Permissions:** Accessing the Google Scholar API often requires authentication and authorization, which can involve complex setup and management of API keys and permissions.\n\n* **Rate Limits and Usage Restrictions:** The Google Scholar API may impose rate limits or usage restrictions, which can limit the number of requests that can be made within a certain time frame. This can be a challenge for applications that require frequent or large-scale access to the API.\n\n**BibTeX Entries:**\n\n* **Formatting and Syntax:** BibTeX entries follow a specific format and syntax, which can be complex and challenging to learn and use correctly. This can lead to errors and inconsistencies in citations and references.\n\n* **Citation Management:** Managing large numbers of BibTeX entries can be time-consuming and error-prone. This can be especially challenging for researchers and academics who need to keep track of numerous citations and references.\n\n* **Compatibility and Integration:** BibTeX entries need to be compatible with the citation and reference management software or tools being used. This can involve converting between different formats or ensuring proper integration with the software.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it is important to have a strong foundation in computer science, natural language processing, and machine learning. Additionally, staying up-to-date with the latest research and developments in these fields is crucial. Engaging with online communities, attending conferences and workshops, and seeking mentorship from experts can also be beneficial in the learning process.\n",

The API is accessed through the following endpoint: /search?engine=google_scholar. A user may query the following: https://serpapi.com/search?engine=google_scholar utilizing a GET request. Head to the playground for a live and interactive demo.\n\nAPI Parameters\nSearch Query\nq\n\nRequired\n\nParameter defines the query you want to search. You can also use helpers in your query such as: author:, or source:.\n\nUsage of cites parameter makes q optional. Usage of cites together with q triggers search within citing articles.\n\nUsage of cluster together with q and cites parameters is prohibited. Use cluster parameter only.\n\nAdvanced Google Scholar Parameters\ncites\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines unique ID for an article to trigger Cited By searches. Usage of cites will bring up a list of citing documents in Google Scholar. Example value: cites=1275980731835430123. Usage of cites and q parameters triggers search within citing articles.\n\nas_ylo\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the year from which you want the results to be included. (e.g. if you set as_ylo parameter to the year 2018, the results before that year will be omitted.). This parameter can be combined with the as_yhi parameter.\n\nas_yhi\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the year until which you want the results to be included. (e.g. if you set as_yhi parameter to the year 2018, the results after that year will be omitted.). This parameter can be combined with the as_ylo parameter.\n\nscisbd\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines articles added in the last year, sorted by date. It can be set to 1 to include only abstracts, or 2 to include everything. The default value is 0 which means that the articles are sorted by relevance.\n\ncluster\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines unique ID for an article to trigger All Versions searches. Example value: cluster=1275980731835430123. Usage of cluster together with q and cites parameters is prohibited. Use cluster parameter only.\n\nLocalization\nhl\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the language to use for the Google Scholar search. It's a two-letter language code. (e.g., en for English, es for Spanish, or fr for French). Head to the Google languages page for a full list of supported Google languages.\n\nlr\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines one or multiple languages to limit the search to. It uses lang_{two-letter language code} to specify languages and | as a delimiter. (e.g., lang_fr|lang_de will only search French and German pages). Head to the Google lr languages for a full list of supported languages.\n\nPagination\nstart\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the result offset. It skips the given number of results. It's used for pagination. (e.g., 0 (default) is the first page of results, 10 is the 2nd page of results, 20 is the 3rd page of results, etc.).\n\nnum\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the maximum number of results to return, limited to 20. (e.g., 10 (default) returns 10 results, 20 returns 20 results).\n\nSearch Type\nas_sdt\n\nOptional\n\nParameter can be used either as a search type or a filter.\n\nAs a Filter (only works when searching articles):\n0 - exclude patents (default).\n7 - include patents.\n\nAs a Search Type:\n4 - Select case law (US courts only). This will select all the State and Federal courts.\ne.g. as_sdt=4 - Selects case law (all courts)\n\nTo select specific courts, see the full list of supported Google Scholar courts.\ne.g. as_sdt=4,33,192 - 4 is the required value and should always be in the first position, 33 selects all New York courts and 192 selects Tax Court.\nValues have to be separated by comma (,)\n\nAdvanced Filters\nsafe\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the level of filtering for adult content. It can be set to active, or off (default).\n\nfilter\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines if the filters for 'Similar Results' and 'Omitted Results' are on or off. It can be set to 1 (default) to enable these filters, or 0 to disable these filters.\n\nas_vis\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines whether you would like to include citations or not. It can be set to 1 to exclude these results, or 0 (default) to include them.\n\nSerpapi Parameters\nengine\n\nRequired\n\nSet parameter to google_scholar to use the Google Scholar API engine.\n\nno_cache\n\nOptional\n\nParameter will force SerpApi to fetch the Google Scholar results even if a cached version is already present. A cache is served only if the query and all parameters are exactly the same. Cache expires after 1h. Cached searches are free, and are not counted towards your searches per month. It can be set to false (default) to allow results from the cache, or true to disallow results from the cache. no_cache and async parameters should not be used together.\n\nasync\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the way you want to submit your search to SerpApi. It can be set to false (default) to open an HTTP connection and keep it open until you got your search results, or true to just submit your search to SerpApi and retrieve them later. In this case, you'll need to use our Searches Archive API to retrieve your results. async and no_cache parameters should not be used together. async should not be used on accounts with Ludicrous Speed enabled.\n\napi_key\n\nRequired\n\nParameter defines the SerpApi private key to use.\n\noutput\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the final output you want. It can be set to json (default) to get a structured JSON of the results, or html to get the raw html retrieved.\n\nAPI Results\nJSON Results\nJSON output includes structured data for organic results.\n\nA search status is accessible through search_metadata.status. It flows this way: Processing -> Success || Error. If a search has failed, error will contain an error message. search_metadata.id is the search ID inside SerpApi.\n\nHTML Results\nHTML output is useful to debug JSON results or support features not supported yet by SerpApi.\nHTML output gives you the raw HTML results from Google.",

The API is accessed through the following endpoint: /search?engine=google_scholar. A user may query the following: https://serpapi.com/search?engine=google_scholar utilizing a GET request. Head to the playground for a live and interactive demo.\n\nAPI Parameters\nSearch Query\nq\n\nRequired\n\nParameter defines the query you want to search. You can also use helpers in your query such as: author:, or source:.\n\nUsage of cites parameter makes q optional. Usage of cites together with q triggers search within citing articles.\n\nUsage of cluster together with q and cites parameters is prohibited. Use cluster parameter only.\n\nAdvanced Google Scholar Parameters\ncites\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines unique ID for an article to trigger Cited By searches. Usage of cites will bring up a list of citing documents in Google Scholar. Example value: cites=1275980731835430123. Usage of cites and q parameters triggers search within citing articles.\n\nas_ylo\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the year from which you want the results to be included. (e.g. if you set as_ylo parameter to the year 2018, the results before that year will be omitted.). This parameter can be combined with the as_yhi parameter.\n\nas_yhi\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the year until which you want the results to be included. (e.g. if you set as_yhi parameter to the year 2018, the results after that year will be omitted.). This parameter can be combined with the as_ylo parameter.\n\nscisbd\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines articles added in the last year, sorted by date. It can be set to 1 to include only abstracts, or 2 to include everything. The default value is 0 which means that the articles are sorted by relevance.\n\ncluster\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines unique ID for an article to trigger All Versions searches. Example value: cluster=1275980731835430123. Usage of cluster together with q and cites parameters is prohibited. Use cluster parameter only.\n\nLocalization\nhl\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the language to use for the Google Scholar search. It's a two-letter language code. (e.g., en for English, es for Spanish, or fr for French). Head to the Google languages page for a full list of supported Google languages.\n\nlr\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines one or multiple languages to limit the search to. It uses lang_{two-letter language code} to specify languages and | as a delimiter. (e.g., lang_fr|lang_de will only search French and German pages). Head to the Google lr languages for a full list of supported languages.\n\nPagination\nstart\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the result offset. It skips the given number of results. It's used for pagination. (e.g., 0 (default) is the first page of results, 10 is the 2nd page of results, 20 is the 3rd page of results, etc.).\n\nnum\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the maximum number of results to return, limited to 20. (e.g., 10 (default) returns 10 results, 20 returns 20 results).\n\nSearch Type\nas_sdt\n\nOptional\n\nParameter can be used either as a search type or a filter.\n\nAs a Filter (only works when searching articles):\n0 - exclude patents (default).\n7 - include patents.\n\nAs a Search Type:\n4 - Select case law (US courts only). This will select all the State and Federal courts.\ne.g. as_sdt=4 - Selects case law (all courts)\n\nTo select specific courts, see the full list of supported Google Scholar courts.\ne.g. as_sdt=4,33,192 - 4 is the required value and should always be in the first position, 33 selects all New York courts and 192 selects Tax Court.\nValues have to be separated by comma (,)\n\nAdvanced Filters\nsafe\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the level of filtering for adult content. It can be set to active, or off (default).\n\nfilter\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines if the filters for 'Similar Results' and 'Omitted Results' are on or off. It can be set to 1 (default) to enable these filters, or 0 to disable these filters.\n\nas_vis\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines whether you would like to include citations or not. It can be set to 1 to exclude these results, or 0 (default) to include them.\n\nSerpapi Parameters\nengine\n\nRequired\n\nSet parameter to google_scholar to use the Google Scholar API engine.\n\nno_cache\n\nOptional\n\nParameter will force SerpApi to fetch the Google Scholar results even if a cached version is already present. A cache is served only if the query and all parameters are exactly the same. Cache expires after 1h. Cached searches are free, and are not counted towards your searches per month. It can be set to false (default) to allow results from the cache, or true to disallow results from the cache. no_cache and async parameters should not be used together.\n\nasync\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the way you want to submit your search to SerpApi. It can be set to false (default) to open an HTTP connection and keep it open until you got your search results, or true to just submit your search to SerpApi and retrieve them later. In this case, you'll need to use our Searches Archive API to retrieve your results. async and no_cache parameters should not be used together. async should not be used on accounts with Ludicrous Speed enabled.\n\napi_key\n\nRequired\n\nParameter defines the SerpApi private key to use.\n\noutput\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the final output you want. It can be set to json (default) to get a structured JSON of the results, or html to get the raw html retrieved.\n\nAPI Results\nJSON Results\nJSON output includes structured data for organic results.\n\nA search status is accessible through search_metadata.status. It flows this way: Processing -> Success || Error. If a search has failed, error will contain an error message. search_metadata.id is the search ID inside SerpApi.\n\nHTML Results\nHTML output is useful to debug JSON results or support features not supported yet by SerpApi.\nHTML output gives you the raw HTML results from Google.",

The API is accessed through the following endpoint: /search?engine=google_scholar. A user may query the following: https://serpapi.com/search?engine=google_scholar utilizing a GET request. Head to the playground for a live and interactive demo.\n\nAPI Parameters\nSearch Query\nq\n\nRequired\n\nParameter defines the query you want to search. You can also use helpers in your query such as: author:, or source:.\n\nUsage of cites parameter makes q optional. Usage of cites together with q triggers search within citing articles.\n\nUsage of cluster together with q and cites parameters is prohibited. Use cluster parameter only.\n\nAdvanced Google Scholar Parameters\ncites\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines unique ID for an article to trigger Cited By searches. Usage of cites will bring up a list of citing documents in Google Scholar. Example value: cites=1275980731835430123. Usage of cites and q parameters triggers search within citing articles.\n\nas_ylo\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the year from which you want the results to be included. (e.g. if you set as_ylo parameter to the year 2018, the results before that year will be omitted.). This parameter can be combined with the as_yhi parameter.\n\nas_yhi\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the year until which you want the results to be included. (e.g. if you set as_yhi parameter to the year 2018, the results after that year will be omitted.). This parameter can be combined with the as_ylo parameter.\n\nscisbd\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines articles added in the last year, sorted by date. It can be set to 1 to include only abstracts, or 2 to include everything. The default value is 0 which means that the articles are sorted by relevance.\n\ncluster\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines unique ID for an article to trigger All Versions searches. Example value: cluster=1275980731835430123. Usage of cluster together with q and cites parameters is prohibited. Use cluster parameter only.\n\nLocalization\nhl\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the language to use for the Google Scholar search. It's a two-letter language code. (e.g., en for English, es for Spanish, or fr for French). Head to the Google languages page for a full list of supported Google languages.\n\nlr\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines one or multiple languages to limit the search to. It uses lang_{two-letter language code} to specify languages and | as a delimiter. (e.g., lang_fr|lang_de will only search French and German pages). Head to the Google lr languages for a full list of supported languages.\n\nPagination\nstart\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the result offset. It skips the given number of results. It's used for pagination. (e.g., 0 (default) is the first page of results, 10 is the 2nd page of results, 20 is the 3rd page of results, etc.).\n\nnum\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the maximum number of results to return, limited to 20. (e.g., 10 (default) returns 10 results, 20 returns 20 results).\n\nSearch Type\nas_sdt\n\nOptional\n\nParameter can be used either as a search type or a filter.\n\nAs a Filter (only works when searching articles):\n0 - exclude patents (default).\n7 - include patents.\n\nAs a Search Type:\n4 - Select case law (US courts only). This will select all the State and Federal courts.\ne.g. as_sdt=4 - Selects case law (all courts)\n\nTo select specific courts, see the full list of supported Google Scholar courts.\ne.g. as_sdt=4,33,192 - 4 is the required value and should always be in the first position, 33 selects all New York courts and 192 selects Tax Court.\nValues have to be separated by comma (,)\n\nAdvanced Filters\nsafe\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the level of filtering for adult content. It can be set to active, or off (default).\n\nfilter\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines if the filters for 'Similar Results' and 'Omitted Results' are on or off. It can be set to 1 (default) to enable these filters, or 0 to disable these filters.\n\nas_vis\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines whether you would like to include citations or not. It can be set to 1 to exclude these results, or 0 (default) to include them.\n\nSerpapi Parameters\nengine\n\nRequired\n\nSet parameter to google_scholar to use the Google Scholar API engine.\n\nno_cache\n\nOptional\n\nParameter will force SerpApi to fetch the Google Scholar results even if a cached version is already present. A cache is served only if the query and all parameters are exactly the same. Cache expires after 1h. Cached searches are free, and are not counted towards your searches per month. It can be set to false (default) to allow results from the cache, or true to disallow results from the cache. no_cache and async parameters should not be used together.\n\nasync\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the way you want to submit your search to SerpApi. It can be set to false (default) to open an HTTP connection and keep it open until you got your search results, or true to just submit your search to SerpApi and retrieve them later. In this case, you'll need to use our Searches Archive API to retrieve your results. async and no_cache parameters should not be used together. async should not be used on accounts with Ludicrous Speed enabled.\n\napi_key\n\nRequired\n\nParameter defines the SerpApi private key to use.\n\noutput\n\nOptional\n\nParameter defines the final output you want. It can be set to json (default) to get a structured JSON of the results, or html to get the raw html retrieved.\n\nAPI Results\nJSON Results\nJSON output includes structured data for organic results.\n\nA search status is accessible through search_metadata.status. It flows this way: Processing -> Success || Error. If a search has failed, error will contain an error message. search_metadata.id is the search ID inside SerpApi.\n\nHTML Results\nHTML output is useful to debug JSON results or support features not supported yet by SerpApi.\nHTML output gives you the raw HTML results from Google.",
