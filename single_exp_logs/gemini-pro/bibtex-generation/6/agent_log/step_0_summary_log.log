===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to first understand the problem and come up with a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem:
    * The goal is to create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation.
    * The system should be able to find phrases and claims in a paragraph that require citations, use google scholar API to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers, and finally use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries and the bibtext entries for the referred papers.
2. Research the problem:
    * I need to learn more about LLM, google scholar API, and bibtex entries.
3. Design the system:
    * I need to decide on the architecture of the system and the algorithms to use.
4. Implement the system:
    * I need to write the code for the system.
5. Test the system:
    * I need to test the system to make sure it works correctly.
6. Deploy the system:
    * I need to make the system available to users.


Fact Check:  No objective statements in this step.
Thought:  I should start by researching the problem and learning more about LLM, google scholar API, and bibtex entries.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": "."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        arxiv_API_reference.txt
backup/
bibtex_generation.py
claude_example.py
google_scholar_API_reference.txt

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
