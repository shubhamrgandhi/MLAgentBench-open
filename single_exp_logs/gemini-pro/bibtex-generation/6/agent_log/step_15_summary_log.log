===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows that the google_scholar_API_reference.txt file exists in the current directory, but its contents are not accessible in the provided context.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem:
    * The goal is to create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation.
    * The system should be able to find phrases and claims in a paragraph that require citations, use google scholar API to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers, and finally use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries and the bibtext entries for the referred papers.
2. Research the problem:
    * I need to learn more about LLM, google scholar API, and bibtex entries.
3. Design the system:
    * I need to decide on the architecture of the system and the algorithms to use.
4. Implement the system:
    * I need to write the code for the system.
5. Test the system:
    * I need to test the system to make sure it works correctly.
6. Deploy the system:
    * I need to make the system available to users.





Fact Check:   No objective statements in this step.
Thought:   I should continue researching the problem and learn more about LLM, google scholar API, and bibtex entries.
