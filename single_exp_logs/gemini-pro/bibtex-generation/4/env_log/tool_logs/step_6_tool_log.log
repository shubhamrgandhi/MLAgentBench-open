We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and the available tools.
[Action]: The agent lists the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The agent observes the following files in the current directory:
- arxiv_API_reference.txt
- backup/
- bibtex_generation.py
- claude_example.py
- google_scholar_API_reference.txt



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the bibtex_generation.py file. The observation shows that the overall structure of the file and the functions defined in it cannot be found.
[Action]: Understand File
Action Input: {
    "file_name": "bibtex_generation.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "The overall structure of the file and the functions defined in it."
}
[Observation]: In this segment, I cannot find the overall structure of the file and the functions defined in it.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The file bibtex_generation.py does not exist, so I need to create it.
[Action]: I created a new file named bibtex_generation.py with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to bibtex_generation.py. The diff shows that the following line was added to the file:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - Examples of such phrases include names of methods, models, or theories, as well as specific facts or assertions.

2. **Query Google Scholar API:**
   - Construct appropriate queries based on the identified phrases and claims.
   - Utilize the Google Scholar API to search for relevant academic papers.
   - Retrieve the BibTeX entries for the retrieved papers.

3. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Employ the LLM to generate the original paragraph while incorporating the BibTeX entries as citations.
   - Ensure that the citations are properly formatted and placed within the paragraph.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Handle cases where the LLM fails to identify phrases requiring citations or generates incorrect citations.
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API errors or invalid inputs.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.
