Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation provides a comprehensive reflection on the main steps involved in solving the problem. It outlines the key tasks and considerations, including identifying phrases requiring citations, querying the Google Scholar API, generating the original paragraph with citations, and addressing potential challenges.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem and the available tools. Done.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem. Done.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.


Fact Check: 
1. The observation provides a comprehensive reflection on the main steps involved in solving the problem. (directly confirmed)
Thought:  I should start implementing the plan by identifying phrases and claims requiring citations.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To implement the plan of identifying phrases and claims requiring citations, the code needs to be edited to include the function that identifies such phrases.
[Action]: The code in the file bibtex_generation.py is edited to add the function identify_phrases_requiring_citations, which takes a paragraph as input and returns a list of phrases and claims that require citations. The function analyzes the paragraph and identifies phrases that are in uppercase, start with "The" or "A", or are specific facts or assertions.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved as bibtex_generation.py. The diff shows the added code.
