===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to come up with a high level plan to solve it.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.


Fact Check:  
1. This is a high level plan to solve the problem. (guessed)
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem and the available tools.
Action:  List Files
Action Input:  {
    "dir_path": "."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        arxiv_API_reference.txt
backup/
bibtex_generation.py
claude_example.py
google_scholar_API_reference.txt

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
