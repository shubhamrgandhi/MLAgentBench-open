===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation shows that the file bibtex_generation.py has been created with the content "Hello, world!".
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.






Fact Check:    
1. The file bibtex_generation.py has been created with the content "Hello, world!". (directly confirmed)
Thought:    I should now start designing a high level plan to solve the problem.
Action:    Reflection
Action Input:    {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What are the main steps involved in solving the problem?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: 1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - Examples of such phrases include names of methods, models, or theories, as well as specific facts or assertions.

2. **Query Google Scholar API:**
   - Construct appropriate queries based on the identified phrases and claims.
   - Utilize the Google Scholar API to search for relevant academic papers.
   - Retrieve the BibTeX entries for the retrieved papers.

3. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Employ the LLM to generate the original paragraph while incorporating the BibTeX entries as citations.
   - Ensure that the citations are properly formatted and placed within the paragraph.

4. **Additional Considerations:**
   - Handle cases where the LLM fails to identify phrases requiring citations or generates incorrect citations.
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API errors or invalid inputs.
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
