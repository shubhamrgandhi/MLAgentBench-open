===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows the files in the current directory. I can see that there are two files related to the problem: bibtex_generation.py and google_scholar_API_reference.txt.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.




Fact Check:   
1. There are two files related to the problem: bibtex_generation.py and google_scholar_API_reference.txt. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   I should start by understanding the bibtex_generation.py file.
Action:   Understand File
Action Input:   {
    "file_name": "bibtex_generation.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "The overall structure of the file and the functions defined in it."
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        In this segment, I cannot find the overall structure of the file and the functions defined in it.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
