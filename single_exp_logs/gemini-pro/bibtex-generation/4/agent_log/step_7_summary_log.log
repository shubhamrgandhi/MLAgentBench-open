        Reflection:   The observation shows that the code for querying the Google Scholar API has been added to the bibtex_generation.py file.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the available tools. Done.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem. Done.
3. Implement the plan step by step. In progress.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.





Fact Check:  
1. The code for querying the Google Scholar API has been added to the bibtex_generation.py file. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   I should now test the code to make sure it works as expected.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:  
{
    "script_name": "bibtex_generation.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Hello, world!
