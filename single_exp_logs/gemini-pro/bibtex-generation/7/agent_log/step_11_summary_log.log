===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation shows that there are no new files or folders in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem:
    - Understand the input and output format.
    - Understand the requirements of the bibtex entries.
    - Understand the capabilities of the LLM and Google Scholar API.
2. Design a high level algorithm:
    - Use LLM to identify phrases and claims that require citations.
    - Use Google Scholar API to find proper references and get the bibtex entries.
    - Use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries.
3. Implement the algorithm:
    - Write a python script to implement the algorithm.
    - Test the script on a few examples.
4. Evaluate the performance:
    - Measure the accuracy of the bibtex entries.
    - Measure the quality of the generated paragraph.
5. Improve the performance:
    - Fine-tune the LLM and Google Scholar API queries.
    - Use a better algorithm for generating the paragraph.






Fact Check:  No objective statements in this step.
Thought:  I should search the internet for information about how to use the Google Scholar API.
Action:  Undo Edit Script
Action Input:  {
    "script_name": "bibtex_generation.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Content of bibtex_generation.py after undo the most recent edit:

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
