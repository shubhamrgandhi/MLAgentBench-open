Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation shows the files in the current directory.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the problem:
    - Understand the input and output format.
    - Understand the requirements of the bibtex entries.
    - Understand the capabilities of the LLM and Google Scholar API.
2. Design a high level algorithm:
    - Use LLM to identify phrases and claims that require citations.
    - Use Google Scholar API to find proper references and get the bibtex entries.
    - Use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries.
3. Implement the algorithm:
    - Write a python script to implement the algorithm.
    - Test the script on a few examples.
4. Evaluate the performance:
    - Measure the accuracy of the bibtex entries.
    - Measure the quality of the generated paragraph.
5. Improve the performance:
    - Fine-tune the LLM and Google Scholar API queries.
    - Use a better algorithm for generating the paragraph.

6. Search for information about Google Scholar API:
    - Search the internet for relevant tutorials and documentation.
    - Read the Google Scholar API reference documentation.



Fact Check:  No objective statements in this step.
Thought:  I should read the Google Scholar API reference documentation to understand how to use the API.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "google_scholar_API_reference.txt",
    "things_to_look_for": "How to use the Google Scholar API to find references and get BibTeX entries."
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        This context does not mention anything about how to use the Google Scholar API to find references and get BibTeX entries, so I cannot extract the requested data from the provided context.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
