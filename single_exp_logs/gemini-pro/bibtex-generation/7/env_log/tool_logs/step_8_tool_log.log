We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file "claude_example.py" to learn how to use the LLM and Google Scholar API.
[Action]: The action is to read the file "claude_example.py" and extract relevant information about how to use the LLM and Google Scholar API.
[Observation]: The observation is that the file uses the Anthropic API to generate text, but it does not contain information about how to use the Google Scholar API or the specific prompt that was used to generate the text.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to list files in the current directory. This is done to get an overview of the files that are available and to see if there is any information about the Google Scholar API.

[Action]: The action is to list files in the current directory.

[Observation]: The observation is that there are several files in the current directory, including "google_scholar_API_reference.txt".



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand a file named "google_scholar_API_reference.txt" to learn how to use the Google Scholar API.
[Action]: The action is to read the file "google_scholar_API_reference.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is that the context does not mention anything about how to use the Google Scholar API to find references and get bibtex entries.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the "google_scholar_API_reference.txt" file does not contain information about how to use the Google Scholar API to find references and get bibtex entries.
[Action]: List Files
[Observation]: The following files are present in the current directory:
- arxiv_API_reference.txt
- backup/
- bibtex_generation.py
- claude_example.py
- google_scholar_API_reference.txt
- research_log.log


```
Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The file "claude_example.py" uses the Anthropic API to generate text, but it does not contain information about how to use the Google Scholar API or the specific prompt that was used to generate the text.
- There is a file named "google_scholar_API_reference.txt" in the current directory.
- The file "google_scholar_API_reference.txt" does not contain information about how to use the Google Scholar API to find references and get bibtex entries.
- Other files in the current directory include "arxiv_API_reference.txt", "backup/", "bibtex_generation.py", and "research_log.log".
