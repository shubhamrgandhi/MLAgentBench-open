=====================================
Benchmark folder name:  bibtex-generation
Research problem:  Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 3
Reflection: The observation shows that the "google_scholar_API_reference.txt" file does not contain information about how to use the Google Scholar API to find references and get bibtex entries.
Research Plan and Status:
1. Understand the problem:
    - Understand the input and output format.
    - Understand the requirements of the bibtex entries.
    - Understand the capabilities of the LLM and Google Scholar API.
2. Design a high level algorithm:
    - Use LLM to identify phrases and claims that require citations.
    - Use Google Scholar API to find proper references and get the bibtex entries.
    - Use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries.
3. Implement the algorithm:
    - Write a python script to implement the algorithm.
    - Test the script on a few examples.
4. Evaluate the performance:
    - Measure the accuracy of the bibtex entries.
    - Measure the quality of the generated paragraph.
5. Improve the performance:
    - Fine-tune the LLM and Google Scholar API queries.
    - Use a better algorithm for generating the paragraph.


Fact Check: No objective statements in this step.
Thought: I should search the internet for information about how to use the Google Scholar API.
Action: None
