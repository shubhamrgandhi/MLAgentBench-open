According to a recent study, the average American consumes approximately 3,500 calories per day.
This is significantly higher than the recommended daily intake of 2,000 calories.
As a result, many Americans are overweight or obese.
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than one-third of American adults are obese.
This is a serious problem, as obesity can lead to a number of health problems, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.
