We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file "claude_example.py" to learn how to use the anthropic API with an API key stored in "claude_api_key.txt".
[Action]: The action is to understand the file "claude_example.py".
[Observation]: The observation is that the file uses the anthropic API to generate text, reads the API key from "claude_api_key.txt", and calls the `completion` method to generate text. The prompt for the text generation is "How many toes do dogs have?". The `stop_sequences` parameter is set to `[anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT]`, the `model` parameter is set to "claude-v1", and the `max_tokens_to_sample` parameter is set to 100. The response from the API is printed to the console.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - These phrases or claims often indicate the use of specific methods, theories, or prior research findings.

2. **Generate Queries for Google Scholar API:**
   - For each identified phrase or claim, formulate appropriate queries for the Google Scholar API.
   - The queries should be specific and relevant to the context of the paragraph.

3. **Retrieve BibTeX Entries from Google Scholar:**
   - Send the generated queries to the Google Scholar API and retrieve the corresponding BibTeX entries for the relevant papers.
   - Ensure that the retrieved BibTeX entries are accurate and complete.

4. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Use the LLM to generate a new version of the original paragraph that incorporates the BibTeX entries as citations.
   - The LLM should seamlessly integrate the citations into the text, ensuring proper formatting and coherence.

5. **Output the BibTeX Entries:**
   - Generate the BibTeX entries for the cited papers in a separate file or section.
   - Ensure that the BibTeX entries are formatted correctly and adhere to standard conventions.
