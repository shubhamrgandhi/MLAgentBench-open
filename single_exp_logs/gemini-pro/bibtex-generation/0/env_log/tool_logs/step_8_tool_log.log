We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file "claude_example.py" to learn how to use the anthropic API with an API key stored in "claude_api_key.txt".
[Action]: The action is to understand the file "claude_example.py".
[Observation]: The observation is that the file uses the anthropic API to generate text, reads the API key from "claude_api_key.txt", and calls the `completion` method to generate text. The prompt for the text generation is "How many toes do dogs have?". The `stop_sequences` parameter is set to `[anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT]`, the `model` parameter is set to "claude-v1", and the `max_tokens_to_sample` parameter is set to 100. The response from the API is printed to the console.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the tools available before designing a high level plan.
[Action]: The agent reflects on the problem and the tools available.
[Observation]: The agent has understood the problem and the tools available, and is now designing a high level plan.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The first step of the plan is to identify phrases and claims requiring citations.
[Action]: Edited the script bibtex_generation.py to implement the first step of the plan: Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations. Saved the edited file as bibtex_generation_step1.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to bibtex_generation_step1.py. The diff shows that the script now includes code to load the spaCy model, process the text with spaCy, and identify phrases and claims requiring citations. The results are printed to the console.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The action is taken to implement the second step of the research plan, which is to generate queries for the Google Scholar API.
[Action]: The action is to edit the script named "bibtex_generation_step1.py" and save the edited version as "bibtex_generation_step2.py". The edit instruction is to implement the second step of the plan, which is to generate queries for the Google Scholar API.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved as "bibtex_generation_step2.py". The diff shows that the edit adds code to generate queries for the Google Scholar API based on the phrases and claims requiring citations. The queries are printed to the console.
