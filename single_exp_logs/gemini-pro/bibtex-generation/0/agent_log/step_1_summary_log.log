===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the problem and the tools available. I need to design a high level plan.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the tools available. Done.
2. Design a high level plan. In progress.
3. Implement the plan.
4. Test and evaluate the system.
5. Submit the final answer.




Fact Check:   
1. This is a high level plan.
Thought:   I should first understand the problem and the tools available.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What are the key steps involved in solving this problem?"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: 1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - These phrases or claims often indicate the use of specific methods, theories, or prior research findings.

2. **Generate Queries for Google Scholar API:**
   - For each identified phrase or claim, formulate appropriate queries for the Google Scholar API.
   - The queries should be specific and relevant to the context of the paragraph.

3. **Retrieve BibTeX Entries from Google Scholar:**
   - Send the generated queries to the Google Scholar API and retrieve the corresponding BibTeX entries for the relevant papers.
   - Ensure that the retrieved BibTeX entries are accurate and complete.

4. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Use the LLM to generate a new version of the original paragraph that incorporates the BibTeX entries as citations.
   - The LLM should seamlessly integrate the citations into the text, ensuring proper formatting and coherence.

5. **Output the BibTeX Entries:**
   - Generate the BibTeX entries for the cited papers in a separate file or section.
   - Ensure that the BibTeX entries are formatted correctly and adhere to standard conventions.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
