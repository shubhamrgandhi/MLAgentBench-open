Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation provides a high level plan to solve the problem. The plan involves four key steps:
1. Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations
2. Query Google Scholar API
3. Extract BibTeX Entries
4. Generate Original Paragraph with Citations
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.
Current status: Step 1 is completed.
Step 2 is completed.
Step 3 is in progress.






Fact Check:   
1. The observation provides a high level plan to solve the problem. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   I should now start implementing the plan.
Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "bibtex_generation.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following code to the script:\n\nimport anthropic\n\nclient = anthropic.Client(open(\"claude_api_key.txt\").read().strip())",
    "save_name": "bibtex_generation.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to bibtex_generation.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
