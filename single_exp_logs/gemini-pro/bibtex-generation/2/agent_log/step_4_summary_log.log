Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation shows that the code has been edited to include the necessary imports and instantiate the anthropic client.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.
Current status: Step 1 is completed.
Step 2 is completed.
Step 3 is in progress.
Step 3.1 is completed.






Fact Check:    
1. The code has been edited to include the necessary imports and instantiate the anthropic client. (directly confirmed)
Thought:    I should now continue implementing the plan.
