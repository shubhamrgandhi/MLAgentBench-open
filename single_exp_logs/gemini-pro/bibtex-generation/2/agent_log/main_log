================================Start=============================
You are a helpful research assistant. You have access to the following tools:
- List Files:
        Use this to navigate the file system.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: List Files
        Action Input: {
            "dir_path": [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a list of files and folders in dir_path or current directory is dir_path is empty, or an error message if dir_path is invalid.]
        ```

- Copy File:
        Use this to copy a file to a new location with a new name.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Copy File
        Action Input: {
            "source": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            "destination": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [A success message if the file is copied successfully, or an error message if the file cannot be copied.]
        ```

- Undo Edit Script:
        Use this to undo the last edit of the python script.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Undo Edit Script
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script before the last edit. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

- Execute Script:
        Use this to execute the python script. The script must already exist.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Execute Script
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }

        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Final Answer
        Action Input: {
            "final_answer": [a detailed description on the final answer]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be empty.]
        ```

- Understand File:
        Use this to read the whole file and understand certain aspects. You should provide detailed description on what to look for and what should be returned. To get a better understanding of the file, you can use Inspect Script Lines action to inspect specific part of the file.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Understand File
        Action Input: {
            "file_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            "things_to_look_for": [a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a description of relevant content and lines in the file. If the file does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

        ```

- Edit Script (AI):
        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],

            "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Reflection
        Action Input: {
            "things_to_reflect_on": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]
        ```



Research Problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why
Action: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools
Action Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string

Fact Check: 
1. This is the first response from the AI assistant. (guessed)
2. It provides a good starting point for the research plan. (guessed)
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem and available tools in more detail.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "claude_example.py",
    "things_to_look_for": "How to use the anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt."
}

Observation:

```
- The script uses the anthropic API to generate text.
- The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt". (line 3)
- The API key is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. (line 4)
- The `completion` method is called to generate text. (line 6)
- The `prompt` argument is set to a string that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants. (line 7)
- The `stop_sequences` argument is set to a list that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT constant. (line 8)
- The `model` argument is set to "claude-v1". (line 9)
- The `max_tokens_to_sample` argument is set to 100. (line 10)
- The response from the API is printed to the console. (line 11)

In this segment, I cannot find:
- What the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are.
- What the response from the API contains.
```

Step 1:
Reflection:  The observation shows that the script uses the anthropic API to generate text. It also shows how the API key is read from a file and passed to the Client object. However, it does not show what the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are, or what the response from the API contains.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.
Current status: Step 1 is completed.
Step 2 is in progress.




Fact Check:  
1. The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. (directly confirmed)
2. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt". (directly confirmed)
3. The API key is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   I should inspect the script further to find out what the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are, and what the response from the API contains.
Action:   Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "claude_example.py",
    "start_line_number": 1,
    "end_line_number": 11
}
Observation:

```
Here are the lines (the file ends at line 11):

import os
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client(open("claude_api_key.txt").read().strip())
response = client.completion(
    prompt=f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} How many toes do dogs have?{anthropic.AI_PROMPT}",
    stop_sequences = [anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT],
    model="claude-v1",
    max_tokens_to_sample=100,
)
print(response)
```

Step 2:
Reflection:   The observation shows that the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are used to define the prompt for the API call. The response from the API is a JSON object that contains the generated text.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.

2. The response from the API is a JSON object that contains the generated text. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   I should now design a high level plan to solve the problem.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What are the key steps involved in solving the problem?"
}
Observation:

```
Reflection: 1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - The LLM should be able to recognize statements that present facts, theories, or ideas that require proper attribution.

2. **Query Google Scholar API:**
   - Construct appropriate search queries based on the identified phrases and claims.
   - Employ the Google Scholar API to retrieve relevant academic papers for each query.
   - Ensure that the queries are specific and targeted to yield accurate results.

3. **Extract BibTeX Entries:**
   - Parse the retrieved academic papers to extract their corresponding BibTeX entries.
   - Utilize existing Python libraries or web services to facilitate the extraction process.
   - Store the extracted BibTeX entries in a structured format for further processing.

4. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Employ the LLM to generate a modified version of the original paragraph that incorporates the BibTeX entries.
   - The LLM should seamlessly integrate the citations into the text, ensuring proper formatting and coherence.
   - The generated paragraph should accurately reflect the original content while providing appropriate references for the cited information.

```

Step 3:
Reflection:   The observation provides a high level plan to solve the problem. The plan involves four key steps:
1. Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations
2. Query Google Scholar API
