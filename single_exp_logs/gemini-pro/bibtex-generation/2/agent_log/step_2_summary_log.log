Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows that the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are used to define the prompt for the API call. The response from the API is a JSON object that contains the generated text.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to solve the problem.
3. Implement the plan step by step.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system if necessary.
Current status: Step 1 is completed.
Step 2 is completed.
Step 3 is in progress.




Fact Check:   
1. The HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are used to define the prompt for the API call. (directly confirmed)
2. The response from the API is a JSON object that contains the generated text. (directly confirmed)
Thought:   I should now design a high level plan to solve the problem.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What are the key steps involved in solving the problem?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: 1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - The LLM should be able to recognize statements that present facts, theories, or ideas that require proper attribution.

2. **Query Google Scholar API:**
   - Construct appropriate search queries based on the identified phrases and claims.
   - Employ the Google Scholar API to retrieve relevant academic papers for each query.
   - Ensure that the queries are specific and targeted to yield accurate results.

3. **Extract BibTeX Entries:**
   - Parse the retrieved academic papers to extract their corresponding BibTeX entries.
   - Utilize existing Python libraries or web services to facilitate the extraction process.
   - Store the extracted BibTeX entries in a structured format for further processing.

4. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Employ the LLM to generate a modified version of the original paragraph that incorporates the BibTeX entries.
   - The LLM should seamlessly integrate the citations into the text, ensuring proper formatting and coherence.
   - The generated paragraph should accurately reflect the original content while providing appropriate references for the cited information.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
