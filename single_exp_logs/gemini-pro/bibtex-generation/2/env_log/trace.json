The API key is stored in a file named \"claude_api_key.txt\" and is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The script then uses the `Client` object to send a completion request to the API. The request includes a prompt, which is a combination of a human prompt and an AI prompt. The API responds with a completion, which is a text generated by the API.\n[Action]: Inspected lines 1-11 of the script \"claude_example.py\".\n[Observation]: The script imports the `anthropic` module and uses it to create a `Client` object. The API key is read from the file \"claude_api_key.txt\" and passed to the `Client` object. The script then uses the `Client` object to send a completion request to the API.

The next step is to add the function to identify phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations.\n[Action]: Edited the script bibtex_generation.py to add the function identify_phrases_requiring_citations(paragraph).\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to bibtex_generation.py. The diff shows that the function identify_phrases_requiring_citations(paragraph) has been added to the script.\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n[Reasoning]: The script \"bibtex_generation.py\" was executed to continue implementing the plan.\n[Action]: The script \"bibtex_generation.py\" was executed.\n[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a \"FileNotFoundError\" because the file \"claude_api_key.txt\" was not found.\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the file \"claude_api_key.txt\" could not be found.
