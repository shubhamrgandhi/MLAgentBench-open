Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to use the anthropic API with an API key stored in a file.
[Action]: Read the Python script "claude_example.py" to understand how it uses the anthropic API.
[Observation]: The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The `completion` method is called to generate text with the `prompt` argument set to a string that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants. The `stop_sequences` argument is set to a list that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT constant. The `model` argument is set to "claude-v1" and the `max_tokens_to_sample` argument is set to 100. The response from the API is printed to the console. However, the observation does not contain information about what the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are or what the response from the API contains.
