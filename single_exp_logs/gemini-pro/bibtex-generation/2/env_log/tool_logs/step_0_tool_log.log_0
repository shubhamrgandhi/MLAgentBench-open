Given this (partial) file from line 1 character 0 to line 11 character 334: 
    ``` 
    import os
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client(open("claude_api_key.txt").read().strip())
response = client.completion(
    prompt=f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} How many toes do dogs have?{anthropic.AI_PROMPT}",
    stop_sequences = [anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT],
    model="claude-v1",
    max_tokens_to_sample=100,
)
print(response)
    ```
    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How to use the anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The script uses the anthropic API to generate text.
- The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt". (line 3)
- The API key is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. (line 4)
- The `completion` method is called to generate text. (line 6)
- The `prompt` argument is set to a string that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants. (line 7)
- The `stop_sequences` argument is set to a list that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT constant. (line 8)
- The `model` argument is set to "claude-v1". (line 9)
- The `max_tokens_to_sample` argument is set to 100. (line 10)
- The response from the API is printed to the console. (line 11)

In this segment, I cannot find:
- What the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are.
- What the response from the API contains.
===================tokens=====================
Number of prompt tokens: 248
Number of sampled tokens: 237
