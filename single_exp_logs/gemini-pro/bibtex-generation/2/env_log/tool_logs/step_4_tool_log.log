We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to use the anthropic API with an API key stored in a file.
[Action]: Read the Python script "claude_example.py" to understand how it uses the anthropic API.
[Observation]: The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The `completion` method is called to generate text with the `prompt` argument set to a string that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants. The `stop_sequences` argument is set to a list that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT constant. The `model` argument is set to "claude-v1" and the `max_tokens_to_sample` argument is set to 100. The response from the API is printed to the console. However, the observation does not contain information about what the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are or what the response from the API contains.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The script then uses the `Client` object to send a completion request to the API. The request includes a prompt, which is a combination of a human prompt and an AI prompt. The API responds with a completion, which is a text generated by the API.
[Action]: Inspected lines 1-11 of the script "claude_example.py".
[Observation]: The script imports the `anthropic` module and uses it to create a `Client` object. The API key is read from the file "claude_api_key.txt" and passed to the `Client` object. The script then uses the `Client` object to send a completion request to the API. The request includes a prompt, which is a combination of a human prompt and an AI prompt. The API responds with a completion, which is a text generated by the API. The script prints the response to the console.

    Give an answer in natural language paragraphs as truthfully as possible. 
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
1. **Identify Phrases and Claims Requiring Citations:**
   - Utilize the LLM to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations.
   - The LLM should be able to recognize statements that present facts, theories, or ideas that require proper attribution.

2. **Query Google Scholar API:**
   - Construct appropriate search queries based on the identified phrases and claims.
   - Employ the Google Scholar API to retrieve relevant academic papers for each query.
   - Ensure that the queries are specific and targeted to yield accurate results.

3. **Extract BibTeX Entries:**
   - Parse the retrieved academic papers to extract their corresponding BibTeX entries.
   - Utilize existing Python libraries or web services to facilitate the extraction process.
   - Store the extracted BibTeX entries in a structured format for further processing.

4. **Generate Original Paragraph with Citations:**
   - Employ the LLM to generate a modified version of the original paragraph that incorporates the BibTeX entries.
   - The LLM should seamlessly integrate the citations into the text, ensuring proper formatting and coherence.
   - The generated paragraph should accurately reflect the original content while providing appropriate references for the cited information.
