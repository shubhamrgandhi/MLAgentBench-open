We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how to use the anthropic API with an API key stored in a file.
[Action]: Read the Python script "claude_example.py" to understand how it uses the anthropic API.
[Observation]: The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The `completion` method is called to generate text with the `prompt` argument set to a string that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants. The `stop_sequences` argument is set to a list that includes the HUMAN_PROMPT constant. The `model` argument is set to "claude-v1" and the `max_tokens_to_sample` argument is set to 100. The response from the API is printed to the console. However, the observation does not contain information about what the HUMAN_PROMPT and AI_PROMPT constants are or what the response from the API contains.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The script uses the anthropic API to generate text. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt" and is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The script then uses the `Client` object to send a completion request to the API. The request includes a prompt, which is a combination of a human prompt and an AI prompt. The API responds with a completion, which is a text generated by the API.
[Action]: Inspected lines 1-11 of the script "claude_example.py".
[Observation]: The script imports the `anthropic` module and uses it to create a `Client` object. The API key is read from the file "claude_api_key.txt" and passed to the `Client` object. The script then uses the `Client` object to send a completion request to the API. The request includes a prompt, which is a combination of a human prompt and an AI prompt. The API responds with a completion, which is a text generated by the API. The script prints the response to the console.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The action is to reflect on the key steps involved in solving the problem.
[Action]: The action is to reflect on the key steps involved in solving the problem.
[Observation]: The observation is that the LLM can be used to analyze the input paragraph and identify phrases or claims that necessitate citations, construct appropriate search queries based on the identified phrases and claims, employ the Google Scholar API to retrieve relevant academic papers for each query, parse the retrieved academic papers to extract their corresponding BibTeX entries, employ the LLM to generate a modified version of the original paragraph that incorporates the BibTeX entries, and ensure that the generated paragraph accurately reflects the original content while providing appropriate references for the cited information.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the edited file is saved to bibtex_generation.py. It also provides a diff of the edited file.
[Action]: The action is to check if the edit is correct and desirable.
[Observation]: The observation shows the diff of the edited file.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The code has been edited to include the necessary imports and instantiate the anthropic client. The next step is to add the function to identify phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations.
[Action]: Edited the script bibtex_generation.py to add the function identify_phrases_requiring_citations(paragraph).
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to bibtex_generation.py. The diff shows that the function identify_phrases_requiring_citations(paragraph) has been added to the script.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The script "bibtex_generation.py" was executed to continue implementing the plan.
[Action]: The script "bibtex_generation.py" was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a "FileNotFoundError" because the file "claude_api_key.txt" was not found.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the file "claude_api_key.txt" could not be found. I should check if the file exists in the current directory.
[Action]: List files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The file "claude_api_key.txt" is not listed in the current directory.



Step 7:
[Reasoning]: The file "claude_api_key.txt" is not in the current directory, so I need to copy it to the current directory.
[Action]: Copy the file "claude_api_key.txt" to the current directory.
[Observation]: The file "claude_api_key.txt" could not be copied to the current directory.



Step 8:
[Reasoning]: The action is to list files in the current directory to check if the file "claude_api_key.txt" exists.
[Action]: List Files
[Observation]: The observation shows that the file "claude_api_key.txt" is not listed in the current directory.



Step 9:
[Reasoning]: The file "claude_api_key.txt" is not in the current directory. It is possible that the file was copied to the backup folder.
[Action]: List the files in the "backup/" directory.
[Observation]: The "backup/" directory contains the following files:
- bibtex_generation.py_2024-02-05_19-39-18
- bibtex_generation.py_2024-02-05_19-39-54
