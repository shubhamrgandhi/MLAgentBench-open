Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to understand how the LLM is accessed using the anthropic API with an API key in claude_api_key.txt. The action is to understand the file claude_example.py.
[Action]: The action is to understand the file claude_example.py.
[Observation]: The observation is that the LLM is accessed using the anthropic API. The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt". The API key is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object. The `Client` object is used to send a completion request to the LLM. The prompt for the completion request is: "How many toes do dogs have?". The `stop_sequences` parameter is used to specify that the LLM should stop generating text when it encounters the `HUMAN_PROMPT` token. The `model` parameter is used to specify that the LLM should use the "claude-v1" model. The `max_tokens_to_sample` parameter is used to specify that the LLM should generate a maximum of 100 tokens of text. The response from the LLM is printed to the console.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The observation suggests that the API key is obtained from the Anthropic API documentation and the response from the LLM is the text generated by the LLM in response to the prompt.
[Action]: Reflection
[Observation]: To find out how the API key is obtained, one can check the documentation for the Anthropic API. The response from the LLM is the text generated by the LLM in response to the prompt provided. The response can be in any format, depending on the prompt.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The observation provides a step-by-step plan to design a high level plan to address the problem.
[Action]: Reflection
[Observation]:
```
1. **Gather Required Resources:**
   - Obtain an API key from the Anthropic API documentation.
   - Set up the Google Scholar API according to the reference provided in `google_scholar_API_reference.txt`.
   - Create a Python script named `bibtex_generation.py` to house the LLM-based AI system.

2. **Develop the LLM-based AI System:**
   - Utilize the Anthropic API to access the LLM.
   - Design a function to identify phrases and claims in a given paragraph that require citations.
   - Implement a method to query the Google Scholar API using the identified phrases and claims.
   - Retrieve the BibTeX entries for the relevant papers from the Google Scholar API.
   - Generate the original paragraph with the BibTeX entries using the LLM.

3. **Integrate the Components:**
   - Combine the functions and methods developed in Step 2 into a cohesive system within the `bibtex_generation.py` script.
   - Ensure that the system can process any input paragraph and generate the corresponding BibTeX entries.

4. **Test and Refine the System:**
   - Test the system with various input paragraphs to evaluate its performance.
   - Analyze the accuracy and completeness of the generated BibTeX entries.
   - Refine the system as needed to improve its performance and accuracy.

5. **Document and Share the System:**
   - Document the `bibtex_generation.py` script thoroughly, explaining its functionality and usage.
   - Share the script and any associated resources (e.g., API keys, documentation) with the intended users.
