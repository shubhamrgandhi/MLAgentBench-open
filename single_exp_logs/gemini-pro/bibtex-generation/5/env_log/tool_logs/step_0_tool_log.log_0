Given this (partial) file from line 1 character 0 to line 11 character 334: 
    ``` 
    import os
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client(open("claude_api_key.txt").read().strip())
response = client.completion(
    prompt=f"{anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT} How many toes do dogs have?{anthropic.AI_PROMPT}",
    stop_sequences = [anthropic.HUMAN_PROMPT],
    model="claude-v1",
    max_tokens_to_sample=100,
)
print(response)
    ```
    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: How the LLM is accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The LLM is accessed using the anthropic API.
- The API key is stored in a file named "claude_api_key.txt".
- The API key is read from the file and passed to the `Client` object.
- The `Client` object is used to send a completion request to the LLM.
- The prompt for the completion request is: "How many toes do dogs have?".
- The `stop_sequences` parameter is used to specify that the LLM should stop generating text when it encounters the `HUMAN_PROMPT` token.
- The `model` parameter is used to specify that the LLM should use the "claude-v1" model.
- The `max_tokens_to_sample` parameter is used to specify that the LLM should generate a maximum of 100 tokens of text.
- The response from the LLM is printed to the console.

In this segment, I cannot find:
- How the API key is obtained.
- What the response from the LLM is.
===================tokens=====================
Number of prompt tokens: 251
Number of sampled tokens: 225
