        ```
        Action: List Files
        Action Input: {
            "dir_path": [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a list of files and folders in dir_path or current directory is dir_path is empty, or an error message if dir_path is invalid.]
        ```

        }
        Observation: [The observation will be empty.]
        ```

- Understand File:
        Use this to read the whole file and understand certain aspects. You should provide detailed description on what to look for and what should be returned. To get a better understanding of the file, you can use Inspect Script Lines action to inspect specific part of the file.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Understand File
        Action Input: {
            "file_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],

        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],

        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:

        Action Input: {
            "things_to_reflect_on": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]
        ```



Research Problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why
Action: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools
Action Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string
Observation: 
```
the result of the action
```


        Here is a summary of relevant actions and observations you have done:
        ```
        - The LLM is accessed using the Anthropic API with an API key stored in "claude_api_key.txt".
- The API key is obtained from the Anthropic API documentation.
- The LLM response is the text generated by the LLM in response to the prompt.
- The high-level plan to address the problem involves:
  - Gathering required resources (API key, Google Scholar API setup, creating the Python script).
  - Developing the LLM-based AI system (identifying phrases/claims, querying Google Scholar API, retrieving BibTeX entries, generating the original paragraph with BibTeX entries).
  - Integrating the components into a cohesive system.
  - Testing, refining, and documenting the system.
- The first step of the plan (gathering required resources) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script.
        ```
        Here are the exact several steps you have done most recently (up to 3 steps):
        Reflection:  The observation shows that the LLM is accessed using the anthropic API with the API key stored in "claude_api_key.txt". However, it does not show how the API key is obtained or what the response from the LLM is.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to address the problem.
3. Implement the plan and test the system.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system as needed.




Fact Check:  
1. This is a high level plan based on the understanding of the problem and the available tools. It is guessed.
Thought:   I should try to find out how the API key is obtained and what the response from the LLM is.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "How to find out how the API key is obtained and what the response from the LLM is."
}


Observation:
```
Reflection: To find out how the API key is obtained, you can check the documentation for the Anthropic API. It is likely that you will need to create an account with Anthropic and then generate an API key from your account dashboard.

The response from the LLM is the text that is generated by the LLM in response to the prompt that you provide. The response can be in any format, depending on the prompt that you provide. For example, if you provide a prompt that asks the LLM to generate a story, the response will be a story. If you provide a prompt that asks the LLM to answer a question, the response will be an answer to the question.

In the example that you provided, the prompt is: "How many toes do dogs have?". The response from the LLM is: "Dogs typically have 18 toes, with 5 toes on each front paw and 4 toes on each back paw.".

You can find more information about the Anthropic API and how to use it in the Anthropic API documentation.

```
