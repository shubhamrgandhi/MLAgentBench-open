Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation shows that the first step of the plan (Gather Required Resources) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script. However, it does not show how the other steps of the plan have been implemented.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to address the problem.
3. Implement the plan and test the system.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system as needed.






Fact Check:   
1. This is a high level plan based on the understanding of the problem and the available tools. It is guessed.
2. This is a detailed high level plan to address the problem. It is guessed.
3. This is a statement about the implementation of the plan. It is guessed.
Thought:    I should try to implement the other steps of the plan and test the system.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The action is taken to implement the second step of the plan, which is to develop the LLM-based AI system.
[Action]: The action is to edit the `bibtex_generation.py` script to implement the second step of the plan. The script is edited to load the tokenizer and model, define a function to generate text, and generate some text.
[Observation]: The observation shows that the `bibtex_generation.py` script is edited to implement the second step of the plan. The script is edited to load the tokenizer and model, define a function to generate text, and generate some text.
