Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows that the second step of the plan (Develop the LLM-based AI System) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script. However, it does not show how the other steps of the plan have been implemented.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to address the problem.
3. Implement the plan and test the system.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system as needed.








Fact Check:    
1. This is a high level plan based on the understanding of the problem and the available tools. It is guessed.
2. This is a detailed high level plan to address the problem. It is guessed.
3. This is a statement about the implementation of the plan. It is guessed.
Thought:     I should try to implement the other steps of the plan and test the system.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the third step of the plan (Integrate the Components) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script. However, it does not show how the other steps of the plan have been implemented.

[Action]: Edited the `bibtex_generation.py` script to implement the third step of the plan: Integrate the Components.

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `bibtex_generation.py`. The diff shows that the following changes were made:

- Added the `streamlit` library.
- Created a Streamlit app.
- Added a text input field.
- Added a button to generate text.
- Added code to generate text when the button is clicked.
- Added code to display the generated text.
