Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The observation shows that the fourth step of the plan (Test and Refine the System) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script. However, it does not show how the other steps of the plan have been implemented.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to address the problem.
3. Implement the plan and test the system.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system as needed.












Fact Check:      
1. This is a high level plan based on the understanding of the problem and the available tools. It is guessed.
2. This is a detailed high level plan to address the problem. It is guessed.
3. This is a statement about the implementation of the plan. It is guessed.
Thought:       I should try to implement the other steps of the plan and test the system.
Action:       Edit Script (AI)

    "script_name": "bibtex_generation.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Implement the fifth step of the plan: Document and Share the System.",
