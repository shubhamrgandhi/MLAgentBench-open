Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The observation shows that the third step of the plan (Integrate the Components) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script. However, it does not show how the other steps of the plan have been implemented.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the available tools.
2. Design a high level plan to address the problem.
3. Implement the plan and test the system.
4. Evaluate the performance of the system.
5. Revise the plan and improve the system as needed.










Fact Check:     
1. This is a high level plan based on the understanding of the problem and the available tools. It is guessed.
2. This is a detailed high level plan to address the problem. It is guessed.
3. This is a statement about the implementation of the plan. It is guessed.
Thought:      I should try to implement the other steps of the plan and test the system.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the fourth step of the plan (Test and Refine the System) has been implemented in the `bibtex_generation.py` script. However, it does not show how the other steps of the plan have been implemented.
[Action]: Edit the `bibtex_generation.py` script to implement the fourth step of the plan: Test and Refine the System.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to `bibtex_generation.py`. The diff shows that a section for user feedback has been added, along with a button to submit feedback. The system will also continuously monitor for errors and make improvements as needed.
