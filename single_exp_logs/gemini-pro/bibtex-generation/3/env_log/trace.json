The LLM should be accessed using the Anthropic API with the API key stored in `claude_api_key.txt`. The script should also use the LLM to generate the original paragraph with the BibTeX entries inserted.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following tools:\n\n* The Anthropic API provides access to a powerful LLM that can be used to identify phrases and claims in a paragraph that require citations.\n* The Google Scholar API can be used to search for and retrieve academic papers and their BibTeX entries.\n* The `bibtexparser` Python package can be used to parse and manipulate BibTeX entries.\n* The `re` Python package can be used to search for and replace text in a string.\n\nHere is a possible approach to solving the problem:\n\n1. Use the Anthropic API to identify phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations.\n2. Use the Google Scholar API to search for and retrieve academic papers that are relevant to the identified phrases and claims.\n3. Use the `bibtexparser` package to parse the BibTeX entries of the retrieved papers.\n4. Use the `re` package to search for and replace the identified phrases and claims in the paragraph with the corresponding BibTeX entries.\n\nThe resulting script, `bibtex_generation.py`, will be able to take any paragraph as input and generate the original paragraph with the BibTeX entries inserted.\n",
