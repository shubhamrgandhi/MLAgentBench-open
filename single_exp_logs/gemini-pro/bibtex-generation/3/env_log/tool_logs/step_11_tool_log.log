We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```
# Create a new file.

# Provide the full code after the edit, making no other changes. Start the python code with "

Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The research log file could not be read because it did not exist.
[Action]: Created a new research log file named research_log.log.
[Observation]: The new research log file was created and saved.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The research plan includes understanding the problem and the tools available. The observation shows that the research_log.log file has been created, indicating that the research has started. The next step is to understand the problem and the tools available.

[Action]: Reflect on the problem and the tools available.

[Observation]: The research_log.log file has been created.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The action is to create a new file named "bibtex_generation.py" using the provided edit instruction.
[Action]: The action is to create a new file named "bibtex_generation.py" with the following content:

```
# Create a new file

# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Create a new column called 'total' that is the sum of the 'a' and 'b' columns
data['total'] = data['a'] + data['b']

# Create a scatter plot of the 'a' and 'b' columns
plt.scatter(data['a'], data['b'])

# Add a line of best fit to the scatter plot
plt.plot(np.unique(data['a']), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(data['a'], data['b'], 1))(np.unique(data['a'])), color='red')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

[Observation]: The observation is that the edited file is saved to "bibtex_generation.py" and the diff is provided for review.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The necessary libraries need to be imported in order to use them in the script.
[Action]: Edited the bibtex_generation.py script to import the necessary libraries.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to bibtex_generation.py. The diff shows that the necessary libraries are imported.


```
Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:
