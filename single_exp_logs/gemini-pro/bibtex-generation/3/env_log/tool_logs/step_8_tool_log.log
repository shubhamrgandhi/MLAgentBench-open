We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```
# Create a new file.

# Provide the full code after the edit, making no other changes. Start the python code with "

Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The research log file could not be read because it did not exist.
[Action]: Created a new research log file named research_log.log.
[Observation]: The new research log file was created and saved.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The research plan includes understanding the problem and the tools available. The observation shows that the research_log.log file has been created, indicating that the research has started. The next step is to understand the problem and the tools available.

[Action]: Reflect on the problem and the tools available.

[Observation]: The research_log.log file has been created.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The action is to create a new file named "bibtex_generation.py" using the provided edit instruction.
[Action]: The action is to create a new file named "bibtex_generation.py" with the following content:

```
# Create a new file

# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Create a new column called 'total' that is the sum of the 'a' and 'b' columns
data['total'] = data['a'] + data['b']

# Create a scatter plot of the 'a' and 'b' columns
plt.scatter(data['a'], data['b'])

# Add a line of best fit to the scatter plot
plt.plot(np.unique(data['a']), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(data['a'], data['b'], 1))(np.unique(data['a'])), color='red')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

[Observation]: The observation is that the edited file is saved to "bibtex_generation.py" and the diff is provided for review.

**Relevant Information:**

* The research problem is to create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation.
* The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt.
* The system should use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in a given paragraph that require citations, use google scholar API to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers, and finally use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries.
* The research plan includes understanding the problem and the tools available, creating a new file named "bibtex_generation.py", and implementing the LLM based AI system.
* The research is in progress and the first step has been completed.

**Next Steps:**

* Implement the LLM based AI system in the "bibtex_generation.py" file.
* Test the system on different paragraphs.
* Evaluate the performance of the system.
