We are trying to solve this research problem: Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.
    Your current research log:
    ```
    # Create a new file.

# Provide the full code after the edit, making no other changes. Start the python code with "

Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The research log file could not be read because it did not exist.
[Action]: Created a new research log file named research_log.log.
[Observation]: The new research log file was created and saved.

The problem is to create a Python script, `bibtex_generation.py`, that uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to identify phrases and claims in a given paragraph that require citations, and then uses the Google Scholar API to find appropriate references and generate the corresponding BibTeX entries. The LLM should be accessed using the Anthropic API with the API key stored in `claude_api_key.txt`. The script should also use the LLM to generate the original paragraph with the BibTeX entries inserted.

To solve this problem, we can use the following tools:

* The Anthropic API provides access to a powerful LLM that can be used to identify phrases and claims in a paragraph that require citations.
* The Google Scholar API can be used to search for and retrieve academic papers and their BibTeX entries.
* The `bibtexparser` Python package can be used to parse and manipulate BibTeX entries.
* The `re` Python package can be used to search for and replace text in a string.

Here is a possible approach to solving the problem:

1. Use the Anthropic API to identify phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations.
2. Use the Google Scholar API to search for and retrieve academic papers that are relevant to the identified phrases and claims.
3. Use the `bibtexparser` package to parse the BibTeX entries of the retrieved papers.
4. Use the `re` package to search for and replace the identified phrases and claims in the paragraph with the corresponding BibTeX entries.

The resulting script, `bibtex_generation.py`, will be able to take any paragraph as input and generate the original paragraph with the BibTeX entries inserted.
