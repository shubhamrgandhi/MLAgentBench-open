Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows that the Google Scholar API has been imported and used to find appropriate references and generate the corresponding BibTeX entries.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the tools available. Done.
2. Come up with a high level plan. Done.
3. Start implementing the plan. Done.




Fact Check:  
1. Confirmed: The Google Scholar API has been imported and used to find appropriate references and generate the corresponding BibTeX entries.
Thought:   The bibtex_generation.py file is now complete. I should test it with different paragraphs to ensure that it is working correctly.
Action:   Execute Script
Action Input:  
```
{
 "script_name": "bibtex_generation.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
