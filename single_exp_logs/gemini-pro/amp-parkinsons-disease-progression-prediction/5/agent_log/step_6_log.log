        ```

- Edit Script (AI):
        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],

            "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:

        ```



Research Problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.

Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The baseline model has been trained and evaluated.
2. Directly confirmed: The overall cross-validation score is 61.76.
Thought:    The baseline model has a low cross-validation score. I should iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Action:    Reflection
Action Input:    {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What different models or feature selections can be used to improve the performance of the baseline model?"
}
Observation:
```
Reflection: To improve the performance of the baseline model, different models and feature selections can be explored. 

For model selection, more advanced machine learning algorithms can be considered, such as gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, or neural networks. These models may be able to capture more complex relationships in the data and improve predictive performance.

Feature selection is another important aspect to consider. The baseline model uses protein expression frequencies and clinical data as features. However, there may be other relevant features that can be extracted from the data. For example, demographic information, genetic data, or lifestyle factors could be included. Additionally, feature engineering techniques can be applied to transform and combine the existing features to create more informative and discriminative features.

Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning can be performed to optimize the performance of the selected model. Hyperparameters are parameters of the model that are not learned from the data, such as the learning rate or the number of hidden units in a neural network. Tuning these hyperparameters can help improve the model's performance on the given task.

By exploring different models, feature selections, and hyperparameter tuning, it is possible to improve the performance of the baseline model and obtain more accurate predictions of the course of Parkinson's disease.

```

Reflection:     I have reflected on different models and feature selections that can be used to improve the performance of the baseline model.
