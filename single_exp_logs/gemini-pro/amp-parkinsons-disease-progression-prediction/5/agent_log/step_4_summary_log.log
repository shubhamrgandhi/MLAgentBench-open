Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The baseline model has been trained and evaluated.
2. Directly confirmed: The overall cross-validation score is 61.76.
Thought:    The baseline model has a low cross-validation score. I should iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.

        Reflection: To improve the performance of the baseline model, different models and feature selections can be explored. 

For model selection, more advanced machine learning algorithms can be considered, such as gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, or neural networks. These models may be able to capture more complex relationships in the data and improve predictive performance.

Feature selection is another important aspect to consider. The baseline model uses protein expression frequencies and clinical data as features. However, there may be other relevant features that can be extracted from the data. For example, demographic information, genetic data, or lifestyle factors could be included. Additionally, feature engineering techniques can be applied to transform and combine the existing features to create more informative and discriminative features.

Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning can be performed to optimize the performance of the selected model. Hyperparameters are parameters of the model that are not learned from the data, such as the learning rate or the number of hidden units in a neural network. Tuning these hyperparameters can help improve the model's performance on the given task.

By exploring different models, feature selections, and hyperparameter tuning, it is possible to improve the performance of the baseline model and obtain more accurate predictions of the course of Parkinson's disease.
