We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent does not know anything about the data and the machine learning task. It needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before it can design a baseline model.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent learns that the data is mass spectrometry data at the peptide level, protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data, clinical data including patient's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and medication status, and supplemental clinical data without associated CSF samples. The machine learning task is time-series prediction: Predict the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) using protein abundance data. The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the file.

    Reflect on this: What should be the baseline model? What features should be used?

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
The baseline model should be a simple model that can capture the general trend of the data. A linear regression model or a decision tree model could be a good starting point. As for the features, the agent should start with the most relevant features, such as the protein expression frequencies and the clinical data. The agent can then experiment with different feature combinations to see which ones yield the best results.

Here are some specific suggestions for the baseline model and the features:

* Baseline model:
    * Linear regression
    * Decision tree
    * Random forest
* Features:
    * Protein expression frequencies
    * Clinical data (e.g., UPDRS scores, medication status)
    * Supplemental clinical data (if available)

The agent should also consider using a cross-validation strategy to evaluate the performance of the model. This will help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

Once the agent has a baseline model, it can start to iterate over different models and feature selections to try to improve the performance. The agent should keep track of the performance of each model and feature selection so that it can compare them and select the best one.

Finally, the agent should submit the predictions of its best model for the test set as a submission.csv file. The agent should make sure that the submission.csv file is in the correct format and that it is submitted before the deadline.
