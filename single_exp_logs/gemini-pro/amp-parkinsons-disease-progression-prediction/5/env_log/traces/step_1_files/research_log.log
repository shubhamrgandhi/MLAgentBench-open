Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent does not know anything about the data and the machine learning task. It needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before it can design a baseline model.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent learns that the data is mass spectrometry data at the peptide level, protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data, clinical data including patient's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and medication status, and supplemental clinical data without associated CSF samples. The machine learning task is time-series prediction: Predict the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) using protein abundance data. The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the file.
