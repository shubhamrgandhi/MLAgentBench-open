Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent does not know anything about the data and the machine learning task. It needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before it can design a baseline model.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent learns that the data is mass spectrometry data at the peptide level, protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data, clinical data including patient's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and medication status, and supplemental clinical data without associated CSF samples. The machine learning task is time-series prediction: Predict the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) using protein abundance data. The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to design a baseline model to start the machine learning task.
[Action]: Reflection
[Observation]: The baseline model should be simple and capture the general trend of the data. Linear regression or decision tree could be good starting points. The features should include protein expression frequencies and clinical data. Cross-validation should be used to evaluate the model's performance. The agent should iterate over different models and feature selections to improve the performance. The predictions of the best model should be submitted as a submission.csv file.
