Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The participant needs to understand the data and the machine learning task to proceed with the research plan.
[Action]: The participant decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The participant was able to find information about the machine learning task, the data, and the features in the data_description.txt file. However, the participant was not able to find information about the specific algorithms or models that should be used for the machine learning task or the evaluation metric that will be used to assess the performance of the predictions.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: I need to fill in the provided train.py script to train a model.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script contains code for importing necessary libraries, defining a metric, getting predictions, and training a model. The model is trained using RandomForestRegressor and evaluated using cross-validation with the SMAPE metric. The data is cleaned and feature engineered before training the model.
