Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. It adds code to iterate over different models or feature selections and select the best model based on cross-validation performance.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. Done.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: I have understood the data and the machine learning task.
2. Directly confirmed: I have filled in the provided train.py script to train a model.
3. Directly confirmed: I have iterated over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Guessed: I have not yet submitted the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.
Thought:    I should start by submitting the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
"script_name": "train_edited.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
