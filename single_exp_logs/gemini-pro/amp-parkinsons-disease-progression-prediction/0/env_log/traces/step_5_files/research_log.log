Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the file "data_description.txt" to find information about the data and the machine learning task. The agent was instructed to look for specific information in the file, such as the nature of the data, the machine learning task, and any critical lines in the script that provide important details.
[Observation]: The agent was able to find information about the data, the machine learning task, and some critical lines in the script. However, the agent was unable to find specific details about the evaluation metrics that will be used to assess the performance of the predictions.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: I need to fill in the provided train.py script to train a model.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script imports necessary libraries, defines a metric function, a scorer function, and a function to get predictions. It also reads in the data, cleans and engineers the features, and prepares the data for training. However, the model training part is missing.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. The provided train.py script uses a Random Forest Regressor model. Editing the script to add code for iterating over different models or feature selections will allow for the selection of the best model based on cross-validation performance.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to add code for iterating over different models or feature selections and selecting the best model based on cross-validation performance. The edited script is saved as train_edited.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_edited.py. The diff shows the added code for iterating over different models or feature selections and selecting the best model based on cross-validation performance.
