Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent found information about the data, the machine learning task, but could not find information about the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not mentioned in the data_description.txt file, so I need to look for it elsewhere.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The evaluation metric for this competition is SMAPE, which is calculated as the mean of the absolute percentage errors for each prediction.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: I need to inspect the provided train.py script to understand how to fill it in to train a model.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script contains functions to calculate SMAPE, get predictions, and train a model. It also includes code to read and clean the data.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script needs to be edited to add data cleaning and feature engineering code.
[Action]: The following code was added to the end of the train.py script:

```
## data cleaning and feature engineering
# Right now, we only use the month data and the target data
id_list = merged_data['patient_id'].unique().tolist()
data_for_train = {}
for u in target:
    final   = []
    for id_ in id_list:
        infor_of_id  = merged_data[merged_data['patient_id'] == id_]
        month_per_id = infor_of_id.visit_month.tolist()
        for month in month_per_id: 
            check    = [month, id_]
            for plus in [0,6,12,24]:
                if month + plus in month_per_id :
                    month_value = infor_of_id[infor_of_id.visit_month == month+plus][u].values[0]
                    if month_value != np.nan:
                        check.append(month_value)
            if len(check) == 6:
                final.append(check)
    check = pd.DataFrame(final,columns = ['month', 'patient_id',u+'+0',u+'+6',u+'+12',u+'+24'])
    data_for_train[u] = check.dropna()

## train model
model = {}
```

[Observation]: The edited file was saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The script has been executed and the output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cv score of the group model.
[Action]: Execute Script
[Observation]: The overall cv score of the group model is 61.41.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The current model has an overall cv score of 61.41. To improve the performance, I should try different models or feature selections.
[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add code that iterates over different models and feature selections to find the best model. The code uses GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation and find the best hyperparameters for each model.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code.
