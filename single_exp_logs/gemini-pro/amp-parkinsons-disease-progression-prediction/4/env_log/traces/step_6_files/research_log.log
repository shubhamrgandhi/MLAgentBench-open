Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent found information about the data, the machine learning task, but could not find information about the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not mentioned in the data_description.txt file, so I need to look for it elsewhere.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The evaluation metric for this competition is SMAPE, which is calculated as the mean of the absolute percentage errors for each prediction.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: I need to inspect the provided train.py script to understand how to fill it in to train a model.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script contains functions to calculate SMAPE, get predictions, and train a model. It also includes code to read and clean the data.
