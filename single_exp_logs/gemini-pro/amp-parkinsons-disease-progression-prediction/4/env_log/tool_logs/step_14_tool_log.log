===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent found information about the data, the machine learning task, but could not find information about the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not mentioned in the data_description.txt file, so I need to look for it elsewhere.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The evaluation metric for this competition is SMAPE, which is calculated as the mean of the absolute percentage errors for each prediction.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: I need to inspect the provided train.py script to understand how to fill it in to train a model.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script contains functions to calculate SMAPE, get predictions, and train a model. It also includes code to read and clean the data.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script needs to be edited to add data cleaning and feature engineering code.
[Action]: The following code was added to the end of the train.py script:

```
## data cleaning and feature engineering
# Right now, we only use the month data and the target data
id_list = merged_data['patient_id'].unique().tolist()
data_for_train = {}
for u in target:
    final   = []
    for id_ in id_list:
        infor_of_id  = merged_data[merged_data['patient_id'] == id_]
        month_per_id = infor_of_id.visit_month.tolist()
        for month in month_per_id: 
            check    = [month, id_]
            for plus in [0,6,12,24]:
                if month + plus in month_per_id :
                    month_value = infor_of_id[infor_of_id.visit_month == month+plus][u].values[0]
                    if month_value != np.nan:
                        check.append(month_value)
            if len(check) == 6:
                final.append(check)
    check = pd.DataFrame(final,columns = ['month', 'patient_id',u+'+0',u+'+6',u+'+12',u+'+24'])
    data_for_train[u] = check.dropna()

## train model
model = {}
```

[Observation]: The edited file was saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The script has been executed and the output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cv score of the group model.
[Action]: Execute Script
[Observation]: The overall cv score of the group model is 61.41.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The current model has an overall cv score of 61.41. To improve the performance, I should try different models or feature selections.
[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add code that iterates over different models and feature selections to find the best model. The code uses GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation and find the best hyperparameters for each model.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code.
