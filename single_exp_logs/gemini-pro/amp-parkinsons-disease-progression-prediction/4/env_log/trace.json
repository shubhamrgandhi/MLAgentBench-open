The complete set of proteins involved in PD remains an open research question and any proteins that have predictive value are likely worth investigating further. The core of the dataset consists of protein abundance values derived from mass spectrometry readings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gathered from several hundred patients. Each patient contributed several samples over the course of multiple years while they also took assessments of PD severity.\n\nThis is a time-series code competition: you will receive test set data and make predictions with a time-series API. See the evaluation_details.txt for details.\n\nFiles\ntrain_peptides.csv Mass spectrometry data at the peptide level. Peptides are the component subunits of proteins.\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nUniProt - The UniProt ID code for the associated protein. There are often several peptides per protein.\nPeptide - The sequence of amino acids included in the peptide. See this table for the relevant codes. Some rare annotations may not be included in the table. The test set may include peptides not found in the train set.\nPeptideAbundance - The frequency of the amino acid in the sample.\ntrain_proteins.csv Protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data.\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nUniProt - The UniProt ID code for the associated protein. There are often several peptides per protein. The test set may include proteins not found in the train set.\nNPX - Normalized protein expression. The frequency of the protein's occurrence in the sample. May not have a 1:1 relationship with the component peptides as some proteins contain repeated copies of a given peptide.\ntrain_clinical_data.csv\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nupdrs_[1-4] - The patient's score for part N of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Higher numbers indicate more severe symptoms. Each sub-section covers a distinct category of symptoms, such as mood and behavior for Part 1 and motor functions for Part 3.\nupd23b_clinical_state_on_medication - Whether or not the patient was taking medication such as Levodopa during the UPDRS assessment. Expected to mainly affect the scores for Part 3 (motor function). These medications wear off fairly quickly (on the order of one day) so it's common for patients to take the motor function exam twice in a single month, both with and without medication.\nsupplemental_clinical_data.csv Clinical records without any associated CSF samples. This data is intended to provide additional context about the typical progression of Parkinsons. Uses the same columns as train_clinical_data.csv.\n\nexample_test_files/ Data intended to illustrate how the API functions.

It also includes code to read and clean the data.\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n[Reasoning]: The train.py script needs to be edited to add data cleaning and feature engineering code.\n[Action]: The following code was added to the end of the train.py script:\n\n```\n## data cleaning and feature engineering\n# Right now, we only use the month data and the target data\nid_list = merged_data['patient_id'].unique().tolist()\ndata_for_train = {}\nfor u in target:\n    final   = []\n    for id_ in id_list:\n        infor_of_id  = merged_data[merged_data['patient_id'] == id_]\n        month_per_id = infor_of_id.visit_month.tolist()\n        for month in month_per_id: \n            check    = [month, id_]\n            for plus in [0,6,12,24]:\n                if month + plus in month_per_id :\n                    month_value = infor_of_id[infor_of_id.visit_month == month+plus][u].values[0]\n                    if month_value != np.nan:\n                        check.append(month_value)\n            if len(check) == 6:\n                final.append(check)\n    check = pd.DataFrame(final,columns = ['month', 'patient_id',u+'+0',u+'+6',u+'+12',u+'+24'])\n    data_for_train[u] = check.dropna()\n\n## train model\nmodel = {}\n```\n\n[Observation]: The edited file was saved to train.py.

To improve the performance, I should try different models or feature selections.\n[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add code that iterates over different models and feature selections to find the best model. The code uses GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation and find the best hyperparameters for each model.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code.\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n[Reasoning]: The script \"train.py\" was executed to iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.\n[Action]: The script \"train.py\" was executed.\n[Observation]: The execution of the script resulted in a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.\n\n\n\nStep 7:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.\n[Action]: Undo Edit Script\n[Observation]: The script \"train.py\" has been executed with an error: \"SyntaxError: '[' was never closed\". The error is related to a missing closing bracket in the script.\n\n\n\nStep 8:\n[Reasoning]: The script has an error and the error message indicates that there is an unclosed '[' somewhere in the script.\n[Action]: Inspect the lines of the script between line 170 and line 175.\n[Observation]: The provided context does not contain the lines of the script between line 170 and line 175, so the requested information cannot be extracted.\n\n",

It also includes code to read and clean the data.\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n[Reasoning]: The train.py script needs to be edited to add data cleaning and feature engineering code.\n[Action]: The following code was added to the end of the train.py script:\n\n```\n## data cleaning and feature engineering\n# Right now, we only use the month data and the target data\nid_list = merged_data['patient_id'].unique().tolist()\ndata_for_train = {}\nfor u in target:\n    final   = []\n    for id_ in id_list:\n        infor_of_id  = merged_data[merged_data['patient_id'] == id_]\n        month_per_id = infor_of_id.visit_month.tolist()\n        for month in month_per_id: \n            check    = [month, id_]\n            for plus in [0,6,12,24]:\n                if month + plus in month_per_id :\n                    month_value = infor_of_id[infor_of_id.visit_month == month+plus][u].values[0]\n                    if month_value != np.nan:\n                        check.append(month_value)\n            if len(check) == 6:\n                final.append(check)\n    check = pd.DataFrame(final,columns = ['month', 'patient_id',u+'+0',u+'+6',u+'+12',u+'+24'])\n    data_for_train[u] = check.dropna()\n\n## train model\nmodel = {}\n```\n\n[Observation]: The edited file was saved to train.py.

The code uses GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation and find the best hyperparameters for each model.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code.\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n[Reasoning]: The script \"train.py\" was executed to iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.\n[Action]: The script \"train.py\" was executed.\n[Observation]: The execution of the script resulted in a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.\n\n\n\nStep 7:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.\n[Action]: Undo Edit Script\n[Observation]: The script \"train.py\" has been executed with an error: \"SyntaxError: '[' was never closed\". The error is related to a missing closing bracket in the script.\n\n\n\nStep 8:\n[Reasoning]: The script has an error and the error message indicates that there is an unclosed '[' somewhere in the script.\n[Action]: Inspect the lines of the script between line 170 and line 175.\n[Observation]: The provided context does not contain the lines of the script between line 170 and line 175, so the requested information cannot be extracted.\n\n\n\nStep 9:\n[Reasoning]: The error is caused by a missing closing bracket in line 172.\n[Action]: Edit the script to add a closing bracket to the end of line 172.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py.\n\n\n\nStep 10:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to fix an error, so I should execute the script to see if the error is fixed.\n[Action]: Executed the script \"train.py\".\n[Observation]: The script has been executed successfully.

It also includes code to read and clean the data.\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n[Reasoning]: The train.py script needs to be edited to add data cleaning and feature engineering code.\n[Action]: The following code was added to the end of the train.py script:\n\n```\n## data cleaning and feature engineering\n# Right now, we only use the month data and the target data\nid_list = merged_data['patient_id'].unique().tolist()\ndata_for_train = {}\nfor u in target:\n    final   = []\n    for id_ in id_list:\n        infor_of_id  = merged_data[merged_data['patient_id'] == id_]\n        month_per_id = infor_of_id.visit_month.tolist()\n        for month in month_per_id: \n            check    = [month, id_]\n            for plus in [0,6,12,24]:\n                if month + plus in month_per_id :\n                    month_value = infor_of_id[infor_of_id.visit_month == month+plus][u].values[0]\n                    if month_value != np.nan:\n                        check.append(month_value)\n            if len(check) == 6:\n                final.append(check)\n    check = pd.DataFrame(final,columns = ['month', 'patient_id',u+'+0',u+'+6',u+'+12',u+'+24'])\n    data_for_train[u] = check.dropna()\n\n## train model\nmodel = {}\n```\n\n[Observation]: The edited file was saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code was added correctly.\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been executed and the output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cv score of the group model.\n[Action]: Execute Script\n[Observation]: The overall cv score of the group model is 61.41.\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n[Reasoning]: The current model has an overall cv score of 61.41. To improve the performance, I should try different models or feature selections.\n[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add code that iterates over different models and feature selections to find the best model. The code uses GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation and find the best hyperparameters for each model.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code.\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n[Reasoning]: The script \"train.py\" was executed to iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.\n[Action]: The script \"train.py\" was executed.\n[Observation]: The execution of the script resulted in a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.\n\n\n\nStep 7:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.\n[Action]: Undo Edit Script\n[Observation]: The script \"train.py\" has been executed with an error: \"SyntaxError: '[' was never closed\". The error is related to a missing closing bracket in the script.\n\n\n\nStep 8:\n[Reasoning]: The script has an error and the error message indicates that there is an unclosed '[' somewhere in the script.\n[Action]: Inspect the lines of the script between line 170 and line 175.\n[Observation]: The provided context does not contain the lines of the script between line 170 and line 175, so the requested information cannot be extracted.\n\n\n\nStep 9:\n[Reasoning]: The error is caused by a missing closing bracket in line 172.\n[Action]: Edit the script to add a closing bracket to the end of line 172.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py.\n\n\n\nStep 10:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to fix an error, so I should execute the script to see if the error is fixed.\n[Action]: Executed the script \"train.py\".\n[Observation]: The script has been executed successfully. The output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model.\n\n\n\nStep 11:\n[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the performance of the machine learning model. Iterating over different models and feature selections is a common approach to achieve this.\n[Action]: Edited the \"train.py\" script to add code for iterating over different models and feature selections.\n[Observation]: The edited \"train.py\" script is saved. The diff is provided for review.\n\n\n\nStep 12:\n[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to add code for iterating over different models and feature selections. It is necessary to execute the script to see if the code works correctly.\n[Action]: The script \"train.py\" was executed.\n[Observation]: The script has been executed and the output shows the cross-validation scores for different models and feature selections. The overall cross-validation score of the group model is 61.41.\n\n",
