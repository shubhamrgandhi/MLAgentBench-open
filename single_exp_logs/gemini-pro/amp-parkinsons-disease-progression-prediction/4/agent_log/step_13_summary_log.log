Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script has been executed successfully. The output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model. The overall cross-validation score is 61.41.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.













Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed successfully.
2. Directly confirmed: The output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model.
3. Directly confirmed: The overall cross-validation score is 61.41.
Thought:      The overall cross-validation score is not improved. I should try different models or feature selections.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:      
{
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add code to try different models and feature selections.",
    "save_name": "train.py"
}

        The edited file is saved to train.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The overall cross-validation score is not improved. Different models should be tried to get a better performance.
[Action]: Edited the script train.py to add code to try different models. Specifically, GradientBoostingRegressor is added to the list of models to try.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that GradientBoostingRegressor is added to the list of models to try. The cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model are printed.
