===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script has been edited to fix the error.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.









Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been edited to fix the error.
Thought:    I should now execute the script to see if the error is fixed.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    
{
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_0:'] [63.5 53.9 44.8 52.8 43.9 53.2 49.5 56.8] 52.3
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_1:'] [59.9 58.5 49.1 50.2 64.1 66.3 55.  73.1] 59.5
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_2:'] [49.1 67.5 49.8 45.8 56.7 61.1 44.1 46.6] 52.6
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_3:'] [76.2 83.9 87.1 78.9 83.9 83.  77.7 80.6] 81.4
Overall cv score of the group model: 61.46

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to fix an error, so I should execute the script to see if the error is fixed.
[Action]: Executed the script "train.py".
[Observation]: The script has been executed successfully. The output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model.
