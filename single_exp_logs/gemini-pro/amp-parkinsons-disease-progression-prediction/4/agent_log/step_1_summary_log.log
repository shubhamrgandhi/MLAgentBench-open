===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the data and the machine learning task. The evaluation metric is not mentioned in the data_description.txt file. I need to look for it elsewhere.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: I have understood the data and the machine learning task.
Thought:   I should look for the evaluation metric in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Action:   Understand File
Action Input:   {
    "file_name": "evaluation_details.txt",
    "things_to_look_for": "What is the evaluation metric?"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        **Evaluation Metric:** Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)

**Critical Lines:**

```
Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values.
```

**Explanation:**

The evaluation metric for this competition is SMAPE, which is calculated as the mean of the absolute percentage errors for each prediction. SMAPE is defined as 0 when both the actual and predicted values are 0. This metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions made by the models in the competition.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
