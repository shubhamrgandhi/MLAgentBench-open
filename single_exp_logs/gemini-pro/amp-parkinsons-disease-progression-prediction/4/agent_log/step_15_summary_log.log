===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The script has been executed with an error. The error message indicates that the input y should be a 1d array, but it is a 2d array of shape (1082, 4).
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.















Fact Check:       
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed with an error.
2. Directly confirmed: The error message indicates that the input y should be a 1d array, but it is a 2d array of shape (1082, 4).
Thought:       I should fix the error in the script.
Action:       Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:       
{
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Fix the error in the script.",
    "save_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The edited file is saved to train.py. Here is the diff, please check if the edit is correct and desirable:


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
