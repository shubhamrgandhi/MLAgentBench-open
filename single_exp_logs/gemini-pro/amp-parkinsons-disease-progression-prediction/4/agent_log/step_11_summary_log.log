Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The script has been executed successfully. The output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model. The overall cross-validation score is 61.46.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.











Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed successfully.
2. Directly confirmed: The output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cross-validation score of the group model.
3. Directly confirmed: The overall cross-validation score is 61.46.
Thought:     I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The goal is to improve the performance of the machine learning model. Iterating over different models and feature selections is a common approach to achieve this.
[Action]: Edited the "train.py" script to add code for iterating over different models and feature selections.
[Observation]: The edited "train.py" script is saved. The diff is provided for review.
