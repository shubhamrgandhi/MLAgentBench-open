Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.







Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.
Thought:   I should now debug the script and fix the error.
Action:   Undo Edit Script
Action Input:   
{
    "script_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
         The script "train.py" has been executed with an error: "SyntaxError: '[' was never closed". The error is related to a missing closing bracket in the script.
