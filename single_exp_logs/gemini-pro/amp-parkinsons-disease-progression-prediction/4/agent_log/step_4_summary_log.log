===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit is correct and desirable. It adds the necessary code for data cleaning and feature engineering.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. In progress
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.






Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The edit is correct and desirable. It adds the necessary code for data cleaning and feature engineering.
Thought:     I should now run the script to train the model.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_0:'] [63.5 53.9 44.8 52.8 43.8 53.2 49.5 56.9] 52.3
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_1:'] [59.8 58.6 49.  50.3 64.1 66.2 55.  73.2] 59.5
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_2:'] [49.1 67.4 49.9 45.8 56.7 61.1 44.2 46.5] 52.6
Cross-validation scores
['updrs_3:'] [76.2 83.7 87.1 78.8 83.6 82.9 77.6 80.1] 81.3
Overall cv score of the group model: 61.41

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script has been executed and the output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cv score of the group model.
[Action]: Execute Script
[Observation]: The overall cv score of the group model is 61.41.
