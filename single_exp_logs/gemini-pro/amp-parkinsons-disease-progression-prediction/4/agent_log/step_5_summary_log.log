Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The script has been executed successfully and the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cv score of the group model have been printed. The overall cv score of the group model is 61.41.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.



Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed successfully and the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall cv score of the group model have been printed. The overall cv score of the group model is 61.41.
Thought:  I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The current model has an overall cv score of 61.41. To improve the performance, I should try different models or feature selections.
[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add code that iterates over different models and feature selections to find the best model. The code uses GridSearchCV to perform cross-validation and find the best hyperparameters for each model.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code.
