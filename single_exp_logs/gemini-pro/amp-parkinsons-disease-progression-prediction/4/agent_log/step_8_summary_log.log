===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.







Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed with an error. The error is a SyntaxError: '[' was never closed.
Thought:   I should now debug the script and fix the error.
Action:   Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:

    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 170,
    "end_line_number": 175
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
