We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not specified in the data_description.txt file, so I need to find it elsewhere.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is SMAPE. The next step is to load the data and create a baseline model.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The following files are listed:
```
backup/
data_description.txt
evaluation_details.txt
example_test_files/
public_timeseries_testing_util.py
research_log.log
supplemental_clinical_data.csv
train.py
train_clinical_data.csv
train_peptides.csv
train_proteins.csv
```



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to load the data and create a baseline model. The pandas library is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
[Action]: The code snippet imports the pandas library and loads the four data files into pandas DataFrames: train_peptides, train_proteins, train_clinical_data, and supplemental_clinical_data.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code for loading the data.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: To create a baseline model, I need to use a simple machine learning algorithm. Linear regression is a good choice for this purpose.
[Action]: I have added the code to create and train a linear regression model to the train.py script.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code to create and train a linear regression model has been added to the end of the script.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: The script has been executed, and the output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall CV score of the group model. However, there is an error at the end of the output indicating that the variable `X_train` is not defined.
[Action]: None
[Observation]: The script has been executed, and the output shows the cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall CV score of the group model. However, there is an error at the end of the output indicating that the variable `X_train` is not defined.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The error message "NameError: name 'X_train' is not defined" indicates that the variable X_train is not defined in the script. To understand why, I need to inspect the script lines where X_train is used.
[Action]: Inspected lines 140 to 155 of the script train.py.
[Observation]: The variable X_train is used in line 154 to train the baseline model. However, there is no code that defines or assigns a value to X_train.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The evaluation metric for this machine learning task is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).
- The data is loaded into four pandas DataFrames: train_peptides, train_proteins, train_clinical_data, and supplemental_clinical_data.
- A baseline linear regression model is created and trained.
- The cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall CV score of the group model are displayed.
- There is an error at the end of the output indicating that the variable `X_train` is not defined.
- The variable `X_train` is used in line 154 of the script train.py to train the baseline model, but it is not defined or assigned a value anywhere in the script.
