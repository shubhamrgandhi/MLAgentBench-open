===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not specified in the data_description.txt file, so I need to find it elsewhere.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is SMAPE. The next step is to load the data and create a baseline model.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The following files are listed:
```
backup/
data_description.txt
evaluation_details.txt
example_test_files/
public_timeseries_testing_util.py
research_log.log
supplemental_clinical_data.csv
train.py
train_clinical_data.csv
train_peptides.csv
train_proteins.csv
```



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to load the data and create a baseline model. The pandas library is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
[Action]: The code snippet imports the pandas library and loads the four data files into pandas DataFrames: train_peptides, train_proteins, train_clinical_data, and supplemental_clinical_data.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code for loading the data.

Concisely summarize and list all relevant information from the research log that will be helpful for future step in this format:

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
- The evaluation metric for this machine learning task is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).
- The data is stored in four CSV files: train_peptides.csv, train_proteins.csv, train_clinical_data.csv, and supplemental_clinical_data.csv.
- The pandas library is used to load and manipulate the data.
