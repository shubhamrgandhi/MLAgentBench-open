The complete set of proteins involved in PD remains an open research question and any proteins that have predictive value are likely worth investigating further. The core of the dataset consists of protein abundance values derived from mass spectrometry readings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gathered from several hundred patients. Each patient contributed several samples over the course of multiple years while they also took assessments of PD severity.\n\nThis is a time-series code competition: you will receive test set data and make predictions with a time-series API. See the evaluation_details.txt for details.\n\nFiles\ntrain_peptides.csv Mass spectrometry data at the peptide level. Peptides are the component subunits of proteins.\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nUniProt - The UniProt ID code for the associated protein. There are often several peptides per protein.\nPeptide - The sequence of amino acids included in the peptide. See this table for the relevant codes. Some rare annotations may not be included in the table. The test set may include peptides not found in the train set.\nPeptideAbundance - The frequency of the amino acid in the sample.\ntrain_proteins.csv Protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data.\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nUniProt - The UniProt ID code for the associated protein. There are often several peptides per protein. The test set may include proteins not found in the train set.\nNPX - Normalized protein expression. The frequency of the protein's occurrence in the sample. May not have a 1:1 relationship with the component peptides as some proteins contain repeated copies of a given peptide.\ntrain_clinical_data.csv\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nupdrs_[1-4] - The patient's score for part N of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

However, there is no code that defines or assigns a value to X_train.\n\n\n\nStep 7:\n[Reasoning]: The variable X_train is not defined in the script because it is not assigned a value anywhere.\n[Action]: Added code to the script to assign a value to the variable X_train.\n[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py.
