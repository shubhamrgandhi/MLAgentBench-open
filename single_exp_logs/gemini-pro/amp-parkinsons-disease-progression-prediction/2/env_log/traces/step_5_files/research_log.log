Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not specified in the data_description.txt file, so I need to find it elsewhere.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is SMAPE. The next step is to load the data and create a baseline model.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The following files are listed:
```
backup/
data_description.txt
evaluation_details.txt
example_test_files/
public_timeseries_testing_util.py
research_log.log
supplemental_clinical_data.csv
train.py
train_clinical_data.csv
train_peptides.csv
train_proteins.csv
```
