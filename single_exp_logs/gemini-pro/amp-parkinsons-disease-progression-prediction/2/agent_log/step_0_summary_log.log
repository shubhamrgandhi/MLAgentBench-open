===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I need to understand the data and the machine learning task first.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task.
2. Come up with a baseline model.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.


Fact Check: 
1. Guessed: I need to understand the data and the machine learning task.
Thought:  I should start by reading the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "data_description.txt",
    "things_to_look_for": "What is the data? What is the machine learning task? What is the evaluation metric?"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        **Data:**

- Mass spectrometry data at the peptide level (train_peptides.csv)
- Protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data (train_proteins.csv)
- Clinical data including patient's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and medication status (train_clinical_data.csv)
- Supplemental clinical data without associated CSF samples (supplemental_clinical_data.csv)

**Machine Learning Task:**

- Time-series prediction: Predict the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) using protein abundance data.

**Evaluation Metric:**

- In this segment, I cannot find the evaluation metric.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The agent cannot find the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.
