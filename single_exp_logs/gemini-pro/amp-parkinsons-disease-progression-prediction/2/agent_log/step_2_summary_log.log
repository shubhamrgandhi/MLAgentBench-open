===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    I have found the evaluation metric in the evaluation_details.txt file. It is SMAPE.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Come up with a baseline model.
3. Iteratively improve the baseline model.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: I have found the evaluation metric in the evaluation_details.txt file. It is SMAPE.
Thought:    I should start by loading the data and creating a baseline model.
Action:    List Files
Action Input:    {
    "dir_path": "."
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        backup/
data_description.txt
evaluation_details.txt
example_test_files/
public_timeseries_testing_util.py
research_log.log
supplemental_clinical_data.csv
train.py
train_clinical_data.csv
train_peptides.csv
train_proteins.csv

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is SMAPE. The next step is to load the data and create a baseline model.
[Action]: List all files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The following files are listed:
```
backup/

evaluation_details.txt
example_test_files/
public_timeseries_testing_util.py
research_log.log
supplemental_clinical_data.csv
train.py
train_clinical_data.csv
train_peptides.csv
train_proteins.csv
