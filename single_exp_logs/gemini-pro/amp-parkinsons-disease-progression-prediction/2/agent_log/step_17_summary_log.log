Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows the files in the current directory. I can see that the "public_timeseries_testing_util.py" file is present, which is the module that I am trying to import.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Come up with a baseline model. Done
3. Iteratively improve the baseline model.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.
5. Install the "public_times_testing_util" module.
6. Investigate why the script is still failing to import the module.
7. Check if the module was installed correctly and is in the correct location.
8. Check the Python path to make sure that the directory where the module is located is included.






Fact Check:   
1. Guessed: The observation shows the files in the current directory. I can see that the "public_timeseries_testing_util.py" file is present, which is the module that I am trying to import.
Thought:   I should check the Python path to make sure that the directory where the module is located is included.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "How can I check the Python path to make sure that the directory where the \"public_timeseries_testing_util.py\" module is located is included?"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: To check if the directory where the "public_timeseries_testing_util.py" module is located is included in the Python path, you can use the following steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command:

```
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

3. Press Enter.

This will print a list of directories that are included in the Python path.

4. Look for the directory where the "public_timeseries_testing_util.py" module is located.

If the directory is not listed, you can add it to the Python path by using the following steps:

1. Open a text editor.
2. Create a new file called "my_custom_paths.pth".
3. Add the following line to the file:

```
/path/to/directory/where/public_timeseries_testing_util.py/is/located
```

4. Save the file.
5. Copy the file to the following directory:

```
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/
```

6. Restart Python.

The directory where the "public_timeseries_testing_util.py" module is located should now be included in the Python path.

        ```
