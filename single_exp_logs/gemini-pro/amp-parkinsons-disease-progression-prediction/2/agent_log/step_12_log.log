You are a helpful research assistant. You have access to the following tools:
- List Files:
        Use this to navigate the file system.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: List Files
        Action Input: {
            "dir_path": [a valid relative path to a directory, such as "." or "folder1/folder2"]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a list of files and folders in dir_path or current directory is dir_path is empty, or an error message if dir_path is invalid.]
        ```

- Copy File:
        Use this to copy a file to a new location with a new name.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Copy File
        Action Input: {
            "source": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            "destination": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [A success message if the file is copied successfully, or an error message if the file cannot be copied.]
        ```

- Undo Edit Script:
        Use this to undo the last edit of the python script.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Undo Edit Script
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script before the last edit. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

- Execute Script:
        Use this to execute the python script. The script must already exist.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Execute Script
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be output of the script or errors.]
        ```

- Final Answer:
        Use this to provide the final answer to the current task.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Final Answer
        Action Input: {
            "final_answer": [a detailed description on the final answer]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be empty.]
        ```

- Understand File:
        Use this to read the whole file and understand certain aspects. You should provide detailed description on what to look for and what should be returned. To get a better understanding of the file, you can use Inspect Script Lines action to inspect specific part of the file.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Understand File
        Action Input: {
            "file_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            "things_to_look_for": [a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a description of relevant content and lines in the file. If the file does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

- Inspect Script Lines:
        Use this to inspect specific part of a python script precisely, or the full content of a short script. The number of lines to display is limited to 100 lines. This is especially helpful when debugging.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Inspect Script Lines
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            "start_line_number": [a valid line number],
            "end_line_number": [a valid line number]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script between start_line_number and end_line_number . If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]
        ```

- Edit Script (AI):
        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Edit Script (AI)
        Action Input: {
            "script_name": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],
            "edit_instruction": [a detailed step by step description on how to edit it.],
            "save_name": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]
        ```

- Reflection:
        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.
        Usage:
        ```
        Action: Reflection
        Action Input: {
            "things_to_reflect_on": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]
        }
        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]
        ```



Research Problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.

Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Fact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why
Action: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools
Action Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string
Observation: 
```
the result of the action
```


        Here is a summary of relevant actions and observations you have done:
        ```
        - The evaluation metric for this machine learning task is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).
- The data is loaded into four pandas DataFrames: train_peptides, train_proteins, train_clinical_data, and supplemental_clinical_data.
- A baseline linear regression model is created and trained using the training data.
- The cross-validation scores for each UPDRS score and the overall CV score of the group model are displayed as output.
- The variable X_train is not defined in the script, which causes an error when training the model.
- The variable X_train is assigned a value by creating a feature matrix from the training data.
- The script is executed again, and the cross-validation scores are displayed as output.
- The variable train_data is not specified in the edit instruction, so it is added to the code.
- The feature matrix is created using the train_data DataFrame.
- The edited file is saved to train.py.
        ```
        Here are the exact several steps you have done most recently (up to 3 steps):
        Reflection:       The script has been executed again, but there is a new error at line 154 of the script, where the variable X_train is not defined.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Come up with a baseline model. Done
3. Iteratively improve the baseline model.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.












Fact Check:       
1. Directly confirmed: The script has been executed again, but there is a new error at line 154 of the script, where the variable X_train is not defined.
Thought:       I should check the script to see why the variable X_train is not defined.
Action:       Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:       {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "start_line_number": 140,
    "end_line_number": 155
}


Observation:
```
Here are the lines (the file ends at line 154):

    # The API will deliver four dataframes in this specific order:
    for iteration, (test_clinical_data, test_peptides, test_proteins, sample_submission) in enumerate(iter_test):
        # TODO - make your predictions here by modifying 'rating' sample_submission dataframe
        pred = get_predictions(test_clinical_data, model).round(0)

        for index in sample_submission['prediction_id']:
            sample_submission.loc[sample_submission['prediction_id']==index, 'rating'] = pred[pred['prediction_id']==index]['rating'].values
        
        env.predict(sample_submission)   # register your predictions
    
    # Create a baseline model
    model = LinearRegression()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Reflection:        The variable X_train is not defined in the script because it is not assigned a value anywhere.
Research Plan and Status:        
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Come up with a baseline model. Done
3. Iteratively improve the baseline model.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.














Fact Check:        
1. Directly confirmed: The variable X_train is not defined in the script because it is not assigned a value anywhere.
Thought:        I should add code to the script to assign a value to the variable X_train.
Action:        Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:        {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "Add the following code before line 154:\n\n# Create the feature matrix\nX_train = train_data[['age', 'sex', 'UPDRS_0', 'UPDRS_1', 'UPDRS_2', 'UPDRS_3']]",
