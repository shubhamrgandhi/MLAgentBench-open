Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The script execution still resulted in a "ModuleNotFoundError" exception, indicating that the module "public_times_testing_util" is not available, even though I installed it using pip.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Come up with a baseline model. Done
3. Iteratively improve the baseline model.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.
5. Install the "public_times_testing_util" module.
6. Investigate why the script is still failing to import the module.




Fact Check:  
1. Guessed: The script execution still resulted in a "ModuleNotFoundError" exception, indicating that the module "public_times_testing_util" is not available, even though I installed it using pip.
Thought:  I should check if the module was installed correctly and if it is in the correct location.
Action:  Reflection
Action Input:  {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "How can I check if the \"public_times_testing_util\" module was installed correctly and if it is in the correct location?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: To check if the "public_times_testing_util" module was installed correctly and is in the correct location, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Type the following command:

```
pip list | grep public_times_testing_util
```

3. If the "public_times_testing_util" module is installed, you should see output similar to the following:

```
public_times_testing_util (0.1.0)
```

4. If you do not see any output, then the module is not installed. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install public_times_testing_util
```

5. Once the module is installed, you can check its location by typing the following command:

```
pip show public_times_testing_util
```

6. This command will print information about the module, including its location.

7. Make sure that the module is located in a directory that is included in your Python path. You can check your Python path by typing the following command:

```
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

8. If the directory where the module is located is not in your Python path, you can add it by appending it to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

9. Once you have verified that the module is installed correctly and is in the correct location, you can try running your script again.

If you are still having problems, you can try the following:

* Reinstall the module using the `--force-reinstall` option:

```
pip install --force-reinstall public_times_testing_util
```

* Uninstall and then reinstall the module:

```
pip uninstall public_times_testing_util
pip install public_times_testing_util
```

* Check the documentation for the module to see if there are any specific installation instructions.

* Search for help online or in forums to see if others have encountered similar problems.

        ```
