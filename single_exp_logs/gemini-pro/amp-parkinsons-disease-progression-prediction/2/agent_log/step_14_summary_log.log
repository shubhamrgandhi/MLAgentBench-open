===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation provides several ways to install the "public_times_testing_util" module. I should try installing the module using pip, as it is the easiest method.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done
2. Come up with a baseline model. Done
3. Iteratively improve the baseline model.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.
5. Install the "public_times_testing_util" module.


Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed: The observation provides several ways to install the "public_times_testing_util" module.
Thought:  I should install the "public_times_testing_util" module using pip and then execute the script again to see if it runs without errors.
Action: Action:  Execute Script
Action Input:  {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
