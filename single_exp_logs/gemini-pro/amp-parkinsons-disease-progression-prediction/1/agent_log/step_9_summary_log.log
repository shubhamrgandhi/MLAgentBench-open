===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The current directory does not contain the file "train_data.csv". I should check whether the file exists in the "data" directory.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.














Fact Check:       
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:        I should check whether the file "train_data.csv" exists in the "data" directory.
Action:        List Files
Action Input:        {
"dir_path": "data"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
