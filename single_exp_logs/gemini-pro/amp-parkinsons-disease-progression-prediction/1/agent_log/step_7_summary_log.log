===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script failed to execute because the file "train_data.csv" is not found. I should copy the file to the current directory.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.












Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:       I should copy the file "train_data.csv" to the current directory.
Action:       Copy File
Action Input:      {
"source": "C:\\Users\\2671148\\MLAgentBench-open\\workspaces\\single_exp_logs\\gemini-pro\\amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction\\1\\amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction\\data\\train_data.csv",
"destination": "train_data.csv"

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
