Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The script failed to execute because the variable data_train is not defined. I should define this variable before training the model.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.










Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:      I should define the variable data_train.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:     {

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script failed to execute because the variable data_train is not defined. To fix this, the variable data_train needs to be defined before training the model.
[Action]: Added the following code to the beginning of the file train_linear_regression_with_data.py:

```
data_train = pd.read_csv('train_data.csv')
```

Saved the edited file as train_linear_regression_with_data_and_train.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_linear_regression_with_data_and_train.py. The diff shows that the code to read the training data from a CSV file is added to the beginning of the file.
