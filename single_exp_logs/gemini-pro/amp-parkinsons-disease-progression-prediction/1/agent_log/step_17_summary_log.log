Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The previous action listed the files in the current directory. The file "train_data.csv" is not in the current directory. I should check whether it is in the parent directory.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.






Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:    I should check whether the file "train_data.csv" is in the parent directory.
Action:    List Files
Action Input:    {
"dir_path": ".."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: cannot access file .. because it is not in the work directory.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
