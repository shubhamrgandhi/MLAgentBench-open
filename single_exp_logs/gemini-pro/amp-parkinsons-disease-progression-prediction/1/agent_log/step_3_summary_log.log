===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The script failed to execute because the variables X_train and y_train are not defined. I should define these variables before training the model.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.








Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:     I should define the variables X_train and y_train.
Action:     Edit Script (AI)

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script failed to execute because the variables X_train and y_train were not defined. The action adds the code to define these variables to the beginning of the script.
[Action]: The action edits the script train_linear_regression.py and saves the edited file as train_linear_regression_with_data.py. The edit adds the following code to the beginning of the file:

```
X_train = data_train.drop(['patient_id', 'visit_id', 'visit_month', 'updrs_0', 'updrs_1', 'updrs_2', 'updrs_3', 'updrs_4'], axis=1)
y_train = data_train[['updrs_0', 'updrs_1', 'updrs_2', 'updrs_3']]
```

[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_linear_regression_with_data.py. The diff shows the added code.
