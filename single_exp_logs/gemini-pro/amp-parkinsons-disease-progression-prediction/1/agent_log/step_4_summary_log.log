Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit is correct and desirable. The code now defines the variables X_train and y_train.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.








Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:     I should now execute the script to see the performance.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
"script_name": "train_linear_regression_with_data.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):

              ^^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'data_train' is not defined

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
