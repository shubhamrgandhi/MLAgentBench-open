Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The edit is correct and desirable. The code now trains a linear regression model.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and the task. Done.
2. Train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
3. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.






Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Guessed.
3. Guessed.
Thought:    I should now execute the script to see the performance.
