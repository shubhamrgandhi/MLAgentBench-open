We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 
    Your current research log:

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The participant needs to understand the data and the machine learning task first.
[Action]: Read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The participant cannot find the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not specified in the data_description.txt file, so I need to find it elsewhere.
[Action]: I checked the evaluation_details.txt file to see if it contains the evaluation metric.
[Observation]: The evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).

To address the research problem, you should start by understanding the data and the machine learning task by reading the data_description.txt file. Since the evaluation metric is not specified in this file, you should refer to the evaluation_details.txt file to find that the evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).

Next, you should fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. You can iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. For SMAPE score, the lower is better.

Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.

Some experiments that you could design to address the problem include:

* Trying different machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
* Using different feature selection techniques to select the most informative features for the model.
* Tuning the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate and the number of iterations.
* Trying different data preprocessing techniques, such as scaling and normalization.

You should evaluate the performance of each model using the SMAPE score on a held-out validation set. Once you have found a model that performs well on the validation set, you can train it on the entire training set and submit the predictions for the test set.
