We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. 
Your current Research Plan and Status

    
Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The participant needs to understand the data and the machine learning task first.
[Action]: Read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The participant cannot find the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not specified in the data_description.txt file, so I need to find it elsewhere.
[Action]: I checked the evaluation_details.txt file to see if it contains the evaluation metric.
[Observation]: The evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The agent is tasked with designing experiments to address a research problem. The agent is provided with a data description file and an evaluation details file. The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task, design experiments, train models, and submit predictions for the test set.
[Action]: The agent reflects on the research problem and identifies the need to design experiments to address the problem. The agent considers trying different machine learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing techniques. The agent plans to evaluate the performance of each model using the SMAPE score on a held-out validation set.
[Observation]: The agent has not yet designed any experiments. The agent has not yet trained any models. The agent has not yet submitted any predictions for the test set.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The AI assistant is instructed to edit a script named "train.py" to add code for loading, preprocessing, splitting, training, and evaluating a machine learning model.
[Action]: The AI assistant edits the "train.py" script by adding code to:
- Load the necessary data files, including training data, test data, and supplemental data.
- Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Train a Random Forest Regressor model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using cross-validation and calculate the SMAPE score.
- Print the cross-validation scores and the overall CV score of the group model.
- Make predictions on the test data using the trained model.
- Save the predictions to a submission file in the required format.
[Observation]: The edited "train.py" script is saved with the specified changes. The code is added to the script as instructed, and the script is ready to be executed to train and evaluate the machine learning model.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script was executed to see how it performs.
[Action]: The train.py script was executed.
[Observation]: The script execution resulted in a FileNotFoundError, indicating that the file 'train_suppl.csv' could not be found.



Step 5:
[Reasoning]: To check if the train_suppl.csv file exists, I can list the files in the current directory.
[Action]: I listed the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The train_suppl.csv file is not listed in the current directory.



Step 6:
[Reasoning]: The train_suppl.csv file does not exist in the current directory, so I should check if it exists in the backup folder.
[Action]: List files in the backup folder.
[Observation]: The backup folder contains a file named train.py_2024-02-05_01-23-32.
