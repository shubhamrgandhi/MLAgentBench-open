===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The train.py script failed to execute because it could not find the train_suppl.csv file.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. Done.
3. Train models and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.





Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The train.py script failed to execute because it could not find the train_suppl.csv file.
Thought:     I should check if the train_suppl.csv file exists.
Action:     List Files
Action Input:     {
"dir_path": "."
}

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To check if the train_suppl.csv file exists, I can list the files in the current directory.
[Action]: I listed the files in the current directory.
[Observation]: The train_suppl.csv file is not listed in the current directory.
