===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The train_suppl.csv file does not exist in the backup folder either.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. Done.
3. Train models and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.







Fact Check:       
1. Directly confirmed: The train_suppl.csv file does not exist in the backup folder either.
Thought:       I should check if the train_suppl.csv file exists in the example_test_files folder.
Action:       List Files
Action Input:       {
"dir_path": "example_test_files/"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        sample_submission.csv
test.csv
test_peptides.csv
test_proteins.csv

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The train_suppl.csv file was not found in the backup folder. It is possible that the file is located in the example_test_files folder.
[Action]: Listed the files in the example_test_files folder.
[Observation]: The following files were found in the example_test_files folder:
- sample_submission.csv
- test.csv
- test_peptides.csv
- test_proteins.csv

The train_suppl.csv file was not found in the example_test_files folder.
