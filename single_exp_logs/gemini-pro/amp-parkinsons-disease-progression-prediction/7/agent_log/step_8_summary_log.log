===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The train_suppl.csv file does not exist in the example_test_files folder either.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem. Done.
3. Train models and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.









Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The train_suppl.csv file does not exist in the example_test_files folder either.
Thought:      I should check if the train_suppl.csv file exists in the supplemental_clinical_data.csv file.
Action:      Understand File
Action Input:      {
"file_name": "supplemental_clinical_data.csv",
"things_to_look_for": "Whether the train_suppl.csv file exists in the supplemental_clinical_data.csv file."
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        In this segment, I cannot find the answer to whether the train_suppl.csv file exists in the supplemental_clinical_data.csv file.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The train_suppl.csv file is not found in the example_test_files folder. It is possible that the file is located in the supplemental_clinical_data.csv file.
[Action]: Understand File
[Observation]: The observation does not contain information about whether the train_suppl.csv file exists in the supplemental_clinical_data.csv file.
