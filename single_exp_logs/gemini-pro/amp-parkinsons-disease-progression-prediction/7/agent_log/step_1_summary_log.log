===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have understood the data and the machine learning task. The evaluation metric is not specified in the data_description.txt file. I need to find it elsewhere.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem.
3. Train models and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: I have understood the data and the machine learning task.
Thought:   I should check the evaluation_details.txt file to see if it contains the evaluation metric.
Action:   Understand File
Action Input:   {
"file_name": "evaluation_details.txt",
"things_to_look_for": "What is the evaluation metric?"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        - Evaluation metric: Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)
- Critical lines:
    - "Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values." (line 1)
    - "We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0." (line 2)
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
