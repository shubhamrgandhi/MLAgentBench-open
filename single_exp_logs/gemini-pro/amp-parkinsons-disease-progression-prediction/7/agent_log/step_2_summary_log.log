===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have found the evaluation metric in the evaluation_details.txt file. It is SMAPE.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Design experiments to address the problem.
3. Train models and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.




Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: I have found the evaluation metric in the evaluation_details.txt file. It is SMAPE.
Thought:   I should start designing experiments to address the problem. I can try different models and feature selections to see which one gives me the best performance.
Action:   Reflection
Action Input:   {
"things_to_reflect_on": "What experiments should I design to address the problem?"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: To address the research problem, you should start by understanding the data and the machine learning task by reading the data_description.txt file. Since the evaluation metric is not specified in this file, you should refer to the evaluation_details.txt file to find that the evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).

Next, you should fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. You can iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. For SMAPE score, the lower is better.

Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.

Some experiments that you could design to address the problem include:

* Trying different machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
* Using different feature selection techniques to select the most informative features for the model.
* Tuning the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate and the number of iterations.
* Trying different data preprocessing techniques, such as scaling and normalization.

You should evaluate the performance of each model using the SMAPE score on a held-out validation set. Once you have found a model that performs well on the validation set, you can train it on the entire training set and submit the predictions for the test set.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The agent is tasked with designing experiments to address a research problem. The agent is provided with a data description file and an evaluation details file. The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task, design experiments, train models, and submit predictions for the test set.
