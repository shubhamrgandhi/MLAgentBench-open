Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before proceeding with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
[Observation]: The agent found information about the data, the machine learning task, but could not find information about the evaluation metric in the data_description.txt file.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The evaluation metric is not mentioned in the data_description.txt file, so the user needs to check the evaluation_details.txt file to see if it mentions the evaluation metric.
[Action]: The user checks the evaluation_details.txt file to see if it mentions the evaluation metric.
[Observation]: The evaluation metric is Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: I need to understand the provided train.py script to train a model.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script imports necessary libraries, defines a metric function (smapep1) and a scorer function (smapep1_scorer), and includes a function to get predictions (get_predictions). It also reads and merges data from multiple CSV files, cleans and engineers features, and prepares data for training. The script then trains a model for each target variable using RandomForestRegressor.
