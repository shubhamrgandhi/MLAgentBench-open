Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit is correct and desirable. It adds the code to clean the data, engineer features, and train a model.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. In progress.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.








Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The edit is correct and desirable. It adds the code to clean the data, engineer features, and train a model.
Thought:     I should execute the script to see the results.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

In a future version, this will no longer exclude empty or all-NA columns when determining the result dtypes. To retain the old behavior, exclude the relevant entries before the concat operation.
