Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The error is caused by the line `model[u].fit(data_for_train['month'].values.reshape(-1, 1), data_for_train[u+'+0'].values)`, where `data_for_train['month']` is trying to access a column named 'month' in the data frame `data_for_train`, but there is no such column.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. In progress.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.










Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The error is caused by the line `model[u].fit(data_for_train['month'].values.reshape(-1, 1), data_for_train[u+'+0'].values)`, where `data_for_train['month']` is trying to access a column named 'month' in the data frame `data_for_train`, but there is no such column.
Thought:      I should add the code to create the 'month' column in the data frame `data_for_train`.

[Reasoning]: The error is caused by the line `model[u].fit(data_for_train['month'].values.reshape(-1, 1), data_for_train[u+'+0'].values)`, where `data_for_train['month']` is trying to access a column named 'month' in the data frame `data_for_train`, but there is no such column.
[Action]: Add the following code before the line `model[u].fit(data_for_train['month'].values.reshape(-1, 1), data_for_train[u+'+0'].values)`:
```
data_for_train['month'] = data_for_train['month'].astype(int)
