Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The edit is correct and desirable. It adds the code to convert the 'month' column to an integer data type.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and the machine learning task. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. In progress.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
4. Submit the predictions of the best model for the test set as a submission.csv.












Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The edit is correct and desirable. It adds the code to convert the 'month' column to an integer data type.
Thought:      I should execute the script to see the results.
Action:      Execute Script
Action Input:      {
    "script_name": "train.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

In a future version, this will no longer exclude empty or all-NA columns when determining the result dtypes. To retain the old behavior, exclude the relevant entries before the concat operation.
