We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a language model to get a good performance. Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and the machine learning task before designing experiments and training a language model.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the file named "data_description.txt" to find information about the data and the machine learning task. The agent was instructed to look for answers to the questions: "What is the data?" and "What is the machine learning task?"
[Observation]: The agent found the following information in the file:
- The data consists of argumentative essays written by 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs).
- The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions.
- The task is to predict the score of each of the six measures for the essays given in the test set.

There are various approaches to training a language model, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some commonly used methods include:

1. **Autoregressive Language Models:** These models predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words. They are trained by minimizing the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted word and the actual word in the training data. Examples of autoregressive language models include:
    - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** RNNs use a hidden state to capture information from previous words in the sequence. They can be trained using backpropagation through time, which allows the model to learn long-term dependencies.
    - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** LSTMs are a type of RNN that is specifically designed to learn long-term dependencies. They have a more complex structure than RNNs, but they can achieve better performance on tasks that require long-term memory.
    - **Transformer:** Transformers are a type of neural network that uses attention mechanisms to learn relationships between different parts of a sequence. They are often used for natural language processing tasks, including language modeling.

2. **Non-Autoregressive Language Models:** These models predict the entire sequence of words at once, rather than one word at a time. They are trained by minimizing the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted sequence and the actual sequence in the training data. Examples of non-autoregressive language models include:
    - **Masked Language Models (MLMs):** MLMs are trained by randomly masking a certain percentage of words in the input sequence and then predicting the masked words. This forces the model to learn the meaning of words based on their context.
    - **Permutation Language Models (PLMs):** PLMs are trained by randomly permuting the order of words in the input sequence and then predicting the original order. This forces the model to learn the relationships between words in a sequence.

The choice of language model depends on the specific task and the available data. For example, autoregressive language models are often used for tasks that require generating text, such as machine translation and text summarization. Non-autoregressive language models are often used for tasks that require understanding the meaning of text, such as question answering and sentiment analysis.

In addition to the choice of language model, there are a number of hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve the performance of the model. These hyperparameters include:

- **Learning rate:** The learning rate controls how quickly the model learns. A higher learning rate can lead to faster convergence, but it can also lead to instability.
- **Batch size:** The batch size is the number of samples that are used to update the model's parameters in each iteration. A larger batch size can lead to faster convergence, but it can also require more memory.
- **Number of layers:** The number of layers in a neural network controls the complexity of the model. A deeper network can learn more complex relationships, but it can also be more difficult to train.
- **Dropout:** Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out some of the units in a neural network during training. This helps to prevent overfitting and can improve the generalization performance of the model.

The optimal values for these hyperparameters depend on the specific task and the available data. It is often necessary to experiment with different values to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given task.
