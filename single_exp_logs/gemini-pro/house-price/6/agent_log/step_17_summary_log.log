Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:           The edit is correct and desirable. I can now proceed with executing the script to train the model and see the results.
Research Plan and Status:           
1. Understand the data and all the features. Complete.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Complete.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.






















Fact Check:           
1. Directly confirmed: The edit is correct and desirable.
Thought:           I should execute the train.py script to train the model and see the results.
Action:           Execute Script
Action Input:           {
"script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
