===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The edit is correct and desirable. I can now proceed with executing the script to train the model and see the results.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and all the features. Complete.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Complete.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.








Fact Check:     
1. Guessed: The edit is correct and desirable.
Thought:     I should execute the train.py script to train the model and see the results.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
"script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train MAE: 7,504
Validation MAE: 18,450

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.

[Action]: Execute the script "train.py" to train the model.
[Observation]: The script has been successfully run, and the output is displayed. The output includes the training and the evaluation results. The training mean absolute error (MAE) is 7,504, and the evaluation MAE is 18,450.
