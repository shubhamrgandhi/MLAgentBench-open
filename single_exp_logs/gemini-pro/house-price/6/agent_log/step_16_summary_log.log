Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:           The error is caused by the fact that the feature columns ['feature_4', 'feature_5', 'feature_6'] do not exist in the training data. I need to select the correct feature columns.
Research Plan and Status:           
1. Understand the data and all the features. Complete.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Complete.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.




















Fact Check:           
1. Directly confirmed: The error is caused by the fact that the feature columns ['feature_4', 'feature_5', 'feature_6'] do not exist in the training data.
Thought:           I should select the correct feature columns.
Action:           Edit Script (AI)

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The error is caused by the fact that the feature columns ['feature_4', 'feature_5', 'feature_6'] do not exist in the training data. I need to select the correct feature columns.
[Action]: In the train.py script, I replaced the line feature_cols = ['feature_4', 'feature_5', 'feature_6'] with feature_cols = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'feature_3'].
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the line feature_cols = ['feature_4', 'feature_5', 'feature_6'] is replaced with feature_cols = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'feature_3'].
