Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The model has been trained and the train MAE is 7,504 and the validation MAE is 18,450. This is a good starting point, but I can try to improve the performance by iterating over different models or feature selections.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and all the features. Complete.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Complete.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.










Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: The model has been trained and the train MAE is 7,504 and the validation MAE is 18,450.
Thought:      I should try a different model, such as a Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Action:      Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:      {
"script_name": "train.py",
"edit_instruction": "In the part of the code marked with comments, replace the line\n\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=1)\n\nwith the following code:\n\nmodel = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=1)\n\n",
"save_name": "train.py"

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model trained with RandomForestRegressor has a train MAE of 7,504 and a validation MAE of 18,450. It is a good starting point, but there is room for improvement. Gradient Boosting Regressor is another popular model for regression tasks, so it is worth trying it out to see if it can achieve better performance.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to replace RandomForestRegressor with GradientBoostingRegressor.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the line "model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=1)" is replaced with "model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=1)".
