Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The model has been trained and the train MAE is 11,981 and the validation MAE is 17,686. This is a slight improvement over the Random Forest Regressor, but there is still room for improvement.
Research Plan and Status:       
1. Understand the data and all the features. Complete.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Complete.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.












Fact Check:       
1. Directly confirmed: The model has been trained and the train MAE is 11,981 and the validation MAE is 17,686.
Thought:       I should try a different set of features.
Action:       Edit Script (AI)

        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively

        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The model has been trained with a set of features and the validation MAE is still high. Trying a different set of features might improve the performance.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script to use a different set of features for training the model.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the line `feature_cols = ['feature_1', 'feature_2', 'feature_3']` is replaced with `feature_cols = ['feature_4', 'feature_5', 'feature_6']`.
