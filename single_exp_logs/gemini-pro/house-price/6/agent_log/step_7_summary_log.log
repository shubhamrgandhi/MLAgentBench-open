Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The edit is correct and desirable. I can now proceed with executing the script to train the model and see the results.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and all the features. Complete.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Complete.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.












Fact Check:      
1. Guessed: The edit is correct and desirable.
Thought:      I should execute the train.py script to train the model and see the results.
Action:      Execute Script
Action Input:      {
"script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train MAE: 11,981
Validation MAE: 17,686

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
