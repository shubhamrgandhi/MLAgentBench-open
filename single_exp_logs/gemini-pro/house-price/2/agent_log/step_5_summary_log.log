Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The script has been executed and the output shows that the train MAE is 7,468 and the validation MAE is 18,270. The validation MAE is much higher than the train MAE, which indicates that the model is overfitting. I need to try different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and all the features by reading the data_description.txt file. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections.
5. Select the best model and feature selection based on the evaluation results.
6. Fine-tune the selected model to further improve the performance.
7. Submit the final model and feature selection as the final answer.
8. Write a report to summarize the research process and findings.



Fact Check:     
1. Confirmed: I have read the data_description.txt file and understood the data and all the features.
2. Confirmed: I have filled in the provided train.py script to train a model.
3. Confirmed: I have executed the script and observed the performance of the model.
4. Guessed: I need to evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections.
5. Guessed: I need to select the best model and feature selection based on the evaluation results.
6. Guessed: I need to fine-tune the selected model to further improve the performance.
7. Guessed: I need to submit the final model and feature selection as the final answer.
8. Guessed: I need to write a report to summarize the research process and findings.
Thought:     I should start by evaluating the performance of different models.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To evaluate the performance of different models, I need to first calculate the feature importance of the current model. This will help me understand which features are most important for the model's predictions.
[Action]: I edited the train.py script to calculate and print the feature importance of the model after printing the validation MAE.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code to calculate and print the feature importance has been added after the line that prints the validation MAE.
