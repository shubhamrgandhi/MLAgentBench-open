===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script has been executed successfully and the output shows the training and validation MAE, the feature importance of the trained model, the R2 score on the validation data, and the R2 score on the training data. The R2 score on the training data is 0.97, which is a very good score.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and all the features by reading the data_description.txt file. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections.
5. Select the best model and feature selection based on the evaluation results.
6. Fine-tune the selected model to further improve the performance.
7. Submit the final model and feature selection as the final answer.
8. Write a report to summarize the research process and findings.















Fact Check:      
1. Confirmed: I have read the data_description.txt file and understood the data and all the features.
2. Confirmed: I have filled in the provided train.py script to train a model.
3. Confirmed: I have executed the script and observed the performance of the model.
4. Confirmed: I have calculated and printed the feature importance of the model.
5. Confirmed: I have plotted the feature importance of the model.
6. Confirmed: I have saved the trained model to a file named 'iowa_model.pkl'.
7. Confirmed: I have executed the script again and observed the output.
8. Confirmed: I have calculated and printed the R2 score on the validation data.
9. Confirmed: I have executed the script again and observed the output.
10. Confirmed: I have calculated and printed the R2 score on the training data.
11. Guessed: I need to evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections.
12. Guessed: I need to select the best model and feature selection based on the evaluation results.
13. Guessed: I need to fine-tune the selected model to further improve the performance.
14. Guessed: I need to submit the final model and feature selection as the final answer.
15. Guessed: I need to write a report to summarize the research process and findings.
Thought:       I should start by evaluating the performance of different models.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To evaluate the performance of the model, I need to calculate and print the RMSE score on the validation data and the training data.
[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add the code for calculating and printing the RMSE score on the validation data and the training data.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows that the code for calculating and printing the RMSE score on the validation data and the training data has been added after the line that prints Train R2: {:,.2f}.
