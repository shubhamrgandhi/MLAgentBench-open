===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The train.py script is provided with a Random Forest Regressor model. I can start by training this model on the data and see how it performs.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and all the features by reading the data_description.txt file. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. In progress.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.






Fact Check:   
1. Confirmed: I have read the data_description.txt file and understood the data and all the features.
2. Confirmed: I have filled in the provided train.py script to train a model.
3. Guessed: I need to iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Thought:    I should start by training the Random Forest Regressor model on the data and see how it performs.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\house-price\2\house-price\train.py", line 32, in <module>
    print("Train MAE: {:,.0f}".format(train_mae))
                                      ^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'train_mae' is not defined. Did you mean: 'train_X'?

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script train.py was executed to train a Random Forest Regressor model on the data.

[Action]: The script train.py was executed.

[Observation]: The script execution resulted in an error: "NameError: name 'train_mae' is not defined. Did you mean: 'train_X'?"
