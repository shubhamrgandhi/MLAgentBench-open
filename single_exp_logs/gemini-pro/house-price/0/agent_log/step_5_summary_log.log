Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      I can try different models or feature selections to improve the performance of the model.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and all the features. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Evaluate the performance of the different models and feature selections.








Fact Check:      
1. Confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Confirmed by the previous observation.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:      I should evaluate the performance of the different models and feature selections.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The goal is to evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections to improve the model's performance.
[Action]: Edited the script "train.py" by adding code to evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections. The code includes creating a dictionary of models, fitting each model to the training data, and calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) for both the training and validation sets.
[Observation]: The edited file "train.py" is saved. The diff shows the added code for evaluating the performance of different models and feature selections.
