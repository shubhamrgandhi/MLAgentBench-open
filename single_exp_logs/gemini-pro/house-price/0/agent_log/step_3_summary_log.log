===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The missing part of the train.py script has been filled in. I can now execute the script to train the model.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the data and all the features. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.






Fact Check:     
1. Confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Confirmed by the previous observation.
3. Guessed.
Thought:     I should execute the train.py script to train the model.
Action:     Execute Script
Action Input:     {
"script_name": "train.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train MAE: 7,504
Validation MAE: 18,450

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
