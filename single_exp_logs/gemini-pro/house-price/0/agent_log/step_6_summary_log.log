Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      The script has been edited to evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections. I can now execute the script to evaluate the performance of the different models.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the data and all the features. Done.
2. Fill in the provided train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.
4. Evaluate the performance of the different models and feature selections. In progress.










Fact Check:      
1. Confirmed by the previous observation.
2. Confirmed by the previous observation.
3. Guessed.
4. Guessed.
Thought:      I should execute the train.py script to evaluate the performance of the different models.
Action:      Execute Script
Action Input:      {
"script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train MAE: 7,504
Validation MAE: 18,450
Random Forest Regressor Train MAE: 7503.9971236681895
Random Forest Regressor Validation MAE: 18450.063801369863
Gradient Boosting Machine Train MAE: 11981.20084006214
Gradient Boosting Machine Validation MAE: 17685.728130182575
Support Vector Machine Train MAE: 55772.71494344641
Support Vector Machine Validation MAE: 54824.78520501599

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The script has been edited to evaluate the performance of different models and feature selections. Executing the script will provide the performance metrics for the different models.
[Action]: Executed the script "train.py".
[Observation]: The script has been executed and the performance metrics for the different models are:
