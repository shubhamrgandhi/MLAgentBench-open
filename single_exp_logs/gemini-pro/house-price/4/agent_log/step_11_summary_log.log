Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edit to the train.py script is correct and desirable. The script now selects only the following features: 'LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'HalfBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd', 'Fireplaces', 'GarageCars', 'GarageArea'.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the data and features from data_description.txt. Done.
2. Fill in the train.py script to train a model. Done.
3. Iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance. In progress.


Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed: I have understood the data and features from data_description.txt.
2. Directly confirmed: I have filled in the train.py script to train a model.
3. Directly confirmed: I have executed the train.py script to see the performance of the model.
4. Directly confirmed: I have changed the model to a Gradient Boosting Regressor with 100 estimators and a random state of 1.
5. Directly confirmed: I have executed the train.py script to see the performance of the new model.
6. Directly confirmed: I have selected only the following features: 'LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'HalfBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd', 'Fireplaces', 'GarageCars', 'GarageArea'.
7. Directly confirmed: I have executed the train.py script to see the performance of the new model with the selected features.
8. Directly confirmed: I have changed the model to a Random Forest model with 100 estimators and a random state of 1.
9. Directly confirmed: I have executed the train.py script to see the performance of the new model with the selected features.
10. Directly confirmed: I have edited the train.py script to select only the following features: 'LotArea', 'YearBuilt', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'FullBath', 'HalfBath', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'TotRmsAbvGrd', 'Fireplaces', 'GarageCars', 'GarageArea'.
Thought:  I should now execute the train.py script to see the performance of the new model with the selected features.
Action:  Execute Script
Action Input: 
{
"script_name": "train.py"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Train MAE: 8,427
Validation MAE: 20,113

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: I wanted to see the performance of the new model with the selected features.
[Action]: I executed the train.py script.
[Observation]: The script has been executed. The output shows that the Train MAE is 8,427 and the Validation MAE is 20,113.
