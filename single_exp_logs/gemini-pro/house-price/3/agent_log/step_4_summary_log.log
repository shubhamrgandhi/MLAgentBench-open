===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    I have successfully edited the train.py script to iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance. I can now execute the script to see the results.
Research Plan and Status:    
- Executed the train.py script to see the results.
- Iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance.






Fact Check:    
- I have executed the train.py script to see the results.
Thought:    I should now iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance.
Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
"script_name": "train.py"
}


 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:

  File "D:\TCSCodify\MLAgentBench-open\workspaces\single_exp_logs\gemini-pro\house-price\3\house-price\train.py", line 68
    print(f"Features:
          ^
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 68)

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
