Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and features to train a model.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and features.
[Observation]: The file contains detailed information about residential properties in Ames, Iowa, including general information, building characteristics, and additional features.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to fill in the train.py script to train a model. The script is provided and contains some pre-written code.
[Action]: Inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script imports necessary libraries, loads the data, separates the target variable, selects features, splits the data into training and testing sets, and prints the training and validation MAE. However, the part where the model is trained and evaluated is missing.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is missing the code to train a Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance on the validation data.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script by adding the code to train a Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance on the validation data.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code to train the model and evaluate its performance.
