===================prompt=====================
We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and all the features. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the data and features to train a model.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data_description.txt file to understand the data and features.
[Observation]: The file contains detailed information about residential properties in Ames, Iowa, including general information, building characteristics, and additional features.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to fill in the train.py script to train a model. The script is provided and contains some pre-written code.
[Action]: Inspected the lines of the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script imports necessary libraries, loads the data, separates the target variable, selects features, splits the data into training and testing sets, and prints the training and validation MAE. However, the part where the model is trained and evaluated is missing.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is missing the code to train a Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance on the validation data.
[Action]: Edited the train.py script by adding the code to train a Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance on the validation data.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train.py. The diff shows the added code to train the model and evaluate its performance.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script has been edited to train a Random Forest Regressor model and evaluate its performance on the validation data. The script has been executed to train the model and evaluate its performance.
[Action]: Execute Script
[Observation]: The script has been executed and the output shows that the Train MAE is 7,504 and the Validation MAE is 18,450.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The train.py script is used to train a model to predict the sale price of residential properties in Ames, Iowa. The script currently uses a Random Forest Regressor model with default parameters. The goal is to improve the performance of the model by iterating over different models or feature subsets.
[Action]: Inspected the train.py script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script imports necessary libraries, loads the data, separates the target variable, selects features, splits the data into training and validation sets, creates a Random Forest Regressor model, trains the model on the training data, evaluates the model on the training and validation data, and finally makes predictions on the test data and saves the predictions to a CSV file. The current Train MAE is 7,504 and the Validation MAE is 18,450.
