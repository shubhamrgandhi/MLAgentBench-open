Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The edited script train_gbr.py now contains code to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model and evaluate its performance on the validation data, in addition to the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the data and features by reading data_description.txt. Done
2. Fill in the train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance. In progress
4. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data. Done
5. Compare the performance of the RFR and GBR models and select the better model.




Fact Check:  
1. Directly confirmed: The edited script train_gbr.py now contains code to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model and evaluate its performance on the validation data, in addition to the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model.
Thought:  I should now execute the train_gbr.py script to train and evaluate the RFR and GBR models, and compare their performance.
Action:  Execute Script
Action Input:  
```
{
"script_name": "train_gbr.py"
}
``` 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        The script has been executed. Here is the output:
Random Forest Train MAE: 7,504
Random Forest Validation MAE: 18,450
Gradient Boosting Regressor Train MAE: 11,981
Gradient Boosting Regressor Validation MAE: 17,686

        ```

[Reasoning]: The edited script train_gbr.py now contains code to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model and evaluate its performance on the validation data, in addition to the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model. I should now execute the train_gbr.py script to train and evaluate the RFR and GBR models, and compare their performance.

[Action]: Executed the train_gbr.py script.

[Observation]: The script has been executed and the output shows the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for both the RFR and GBR models on the training and validation data. The MAE for the RFR model is 7,504 on the training data and 18,450 on the validation data. The MAE for the GBR model is 11,981 on the training data and 17,686 on the validation data.
