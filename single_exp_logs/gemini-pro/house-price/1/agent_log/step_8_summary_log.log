Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The output of the train_gbr.py script shows that the RFR model has a Train MAE of 7,504 and a Validation MAE of 18,450, while the GBR model has a Train MAE of 11,981 and a Validation MAE of 17,686. This means that the GBR model has a lower Validation MAE than the RFR model, and therefore performs better on the validation data.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the data and features by reading data_description.txt. Done
2. Fill in the train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance. In progress
4. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data. Done
5. Compare the performance of the RFR and GBR models and select the better model. Done
6. Select the GBR model as the final model and use it to make predictions on the test data.






Fact Check:   
1. Directly confirmed: The output of the train_gbr.py script shows that the RFR model has a Train MAE of 7,504 and a Validation MAE of 18,450, while the GBR model has a Train MAE of 11,981 and a Validation MAE of 17,686. This means that the GBR model has a lower Validation MAE than the RFR model, and therefore performs better on the validation data.
Thought:   I should now select the GBR model as the final model and use it to make predictions on the test data.

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The GBR model has a lower Validation MAE than the RFR model, and therefore performs better on the validation data.
[Action]: Edited the train_gbr.py script to remove the code for training and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor model, and use the Gradient Boosting Regressor model to make predictions on the test data. Saved the edited file as final_model.py.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to final_model.py. The diff shows that the code for training and evaluating the Random Forest Regressor model is removed, and the Gradient Boosting Regressor model is used to make predictions on the test data.
