Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The output of the train.py script shows that the Train MAE is 7,504 and the Validation MAE is 18,450. This means that the model is able to predict the sale price of residential properties in Ames, Iowa with a mean absolute error of $7,504 on the training data and $18,450 on the validation data.
Research Plan and Status: 
1. Understand the data and features by reading data_description.txt. Done
2. Fill in the train.py script to train a model. Done
3. Iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance. In progress
4. Evaluate the performance of the model on the test data. Done



Fact Check: 
1. Directly confirmed: The output of the train.py script shows that the Train MAE is 7,504 and the Validation MAE is 18,450. This means that the model is able to predict the sale price of residential properties in Ames, Iowa with a mean absolute error of $7,504 on the training data and $18,450 on the validation data.
Thought:  I should now iterate over different models or feature subsets to get a better performance.
Action:  Edit Script (AI)

===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To improve the performance of the model, I decided to train a Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model and compare its performance with the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model.
[Action]: I edited the train.py script to add code for training a GBR model and evaluating its performance on the validation data. I also added code to evaluate the performance of the RFR model on the validation data.
[Observation]: The edited file is saved to train_gbr.py. The diff shows that the code for training and evaluating the GBR model has been added. The code for evaluating the RFR model on the validation data has also been added.
