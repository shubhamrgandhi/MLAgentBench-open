Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent does not know anything about the problem and the baseline model, so it needs to start by understanding them.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to understand the task, the dataset, and the evaluation metric.
[Observation]: The agent learns that the task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. The dataset consists of a canonical set of train, eval, and test trajectories for benchmarking out-of-distribution generalization. The problem size refers to the length of an array or the number of nodes in a graph, depending on the algorithm. The multiplier is an algorithm-specific factor that increases the number of available eval and test trajectories to compensate for paucity of evaluation signals. The agent is unable to find information about the evaluation metric in this file.
