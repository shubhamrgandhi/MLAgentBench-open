===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I cannot find the baseline_model_description.txt file.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the baseline model.
2. Design experiments to improve the baseline model performance.
3. Implement the experiments and analyze the results.
4. Submit the final answer.




Fact Check:    
1. Guessed: I cannot find the baseline_model_description.txt file.
2. Guessed: I cannot find the baseline_model_description.txt file.
3. Guessed: I cannot find the baseline_model_description.txt file.
4. Guessed: I cannot find the baseline_model_description.txt file.
Thought:    I should try to find the baseline_model_description.txt file.
Action:    List Files
Action Input:    {
    "dir_path": "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/3\CLRS"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: Cannot list file in the workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/3\CLRS directory
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
