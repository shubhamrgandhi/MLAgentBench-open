    The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark

Learning representations of algorithms is an emerging area of machine learning, seeking to bridge concepts from neural networks with classical algorithms. The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark (CLRS) consolidates and extends previous work toward evaluation algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. These algorithms have been selected from the third edition of the standard Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein.

Algorithms as graphs
CLRS implements the selected algorithms in an idiomatic way, which aligns as closely as possible to the original CLRS 3ed pseudocode. By controlling the input data distribution to conform to the preconditions we are able to automatically generate input/output pairs. We additionally provide trajectories of "hints" that expose the internal state of each algorithm, to both optionally simplify the learning challenge and to distinguish between different algorithms that solve the same overall task (e.g. sorting).

In the most generic sense, algorithms can be seen as manipulating sets of objects, along with any relations between them (which can themselves be decomposed into binary relations). Accordingly, we study all of the algorithms in this benchmark using a graph representation. In the event that objects obey a more strict ordered structure (e.g. arrays or rooted trees), we impose this ordering through inclusion of predecessor links.

How it works
For each algorithm, we provide a canonical set of train, eval and test trajectories for benchmarking out-of-distribution generalization.

Trajectories	Problem Size
Train	1000	16
Eval	32 x multiplier	16
Test	32 x multiplier	64
Here, "problem size" refers to e.g. the length of an array or number of nodes in a graph, depending on the algorithm. "multiplier" is an algorithm-specific factor that increases the number of available eval and test trajectories to compensate for paucity of evaluation signals. "multiplier" is 1 for all algorithms except:

Maximum subarray (Kadane), for which "multiplier" is 32.
Quick select, minimum, binary search, string matchers (both naive and KMP), and segment intersection, for which "multiplier" is 64.
The trajectories can be used like so:

train_ds, num_samples, spec = clrs.create_dataset(
      folder='/tmp/CLRS30', algorithm='bfs',
      split='train', batch_size=32)

for i, feedback in enumerate(train_ds.as_numpy_iterator()):
  if i == 0:
    model.init(feedback.features, initial_seed)
  loss = model.feedback(rng_key, feedback)
Here, feedback is a namedtuple with the following structure:

Feedback = collections.namedtuple('Feedback', ['features', 'outputs'])
Features = collections.namedtuple('Features', ['inputs', 'hints', 'lengths'])
where the content of Features can be used for training and outputs is reserved for evaluation. Each field of the tuple is an ndarray with a leading batch dimension. Because hints are provided for the full algorithm trajectory, these contain an additional time dimension padded up to the maximum length max(T) of any trajectory within the dataset. The lengths field specifies the true length t <= max(T) for each trajectory, which can be used e.g. for loss masking.

    ```
    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: A description of the dataset, including the task, the input format, and the output format.
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".

**Dataset Description:**

**Task:**
- The dataset is designed for benchmarking out-of-distribution generalization of algorithmic reasoning models.

**Input Format:**
- The input to the dataset is a set of trajectories, where each trajectory represents the execution of an algorithm on a specific input.
- Each trajectory consists of a sequence of features, which includes the inputs to the algorithm, hints about the internal state of the algorithm, and the lengths of the trajectory.

**Output Format:**
- The output of the dataset is a set of outputs, which includes the results of the algorithm on the input.
- The outputs are reserved for evaluation purposes.

**Critical Lines:**

- "For each algorithm, we provide a canonical set of train, eval and test trajectories for benchmarking out-of-distribution generalization." (Line 16)
- "Trajectories	Problem Size\nTrain	1000	16\nEval	32 x multiplier	16\nTest	32 x multiplier	64" (Lines 18-21)
- "Here, feedback is a namedtuple with the following structure:" (Line 30)
- "Feedback = collections.namedtuple('Feedback', ['features', 'outputs'])" (Line 31)
- "Features = collections.namedtuple('Features', ['inputs', 'hints', 'lengths'])" (Line 32)

**Additional Notes:**

- The dataset is constructed using a graph representation of algorithms.
- The dataset includes trajectories for a variety of classical algorithms, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- The dataset is designed to be challenging for machine learning models, as it requires the models to learn to reason about the internal state of algorithms.

**In this segment, I cannot find:**

- The specific algorithms that are included in the dataset.
- The format of the inputs and outputs for each algorithm.
