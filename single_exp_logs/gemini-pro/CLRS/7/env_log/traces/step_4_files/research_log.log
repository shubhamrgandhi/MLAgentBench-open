Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and the baseline model.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to find information about the task and the dataset.
[Observation]: The agent learns that the task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. The dataset consists of a canonical set of train, eval, and test trajectories for benchmarking out-of-distribution generalization. The agent is unable to find information about the specific algorithms that are included in the benchmark.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand the baseline model.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "baseline_model_description.txt" to understand the baseline model.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/7\CLRS\baseline_model_description.txt".
