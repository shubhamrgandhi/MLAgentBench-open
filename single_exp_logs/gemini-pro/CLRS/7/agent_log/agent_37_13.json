The number of lines to display is limited to 100 lines. This is especially helpful when debugging.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Inspect Script Lines\n        Action Input: {\n            \"script_name\": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed],\n            \"start_line_number\": [a valid line number],\n            \"end_line_number\": [a valid line number]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script between start_line_number and end_line_number . If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]\n        ```\n\n- Edit Script (AI):\n        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Edit Script (AI)\n        Action Input: {\n            \"script_name\": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],\n            \"edit_instruction\": [a detailed step by step description on how to edit it.],\n            \"save_name\": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]\n        ```\n\n- Reflection:\n        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Reflection\n        Action Input: {\n            \"things_to_reflect_on\": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]\n        ```\n\n\n\nResearch Problem: Improve the baseline model performance on the task floyd_warshall in The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. The dataset description is available in data_description.txt, and the baseline model architecture description is available in baseline_model_description.txt. To run the baseline model, execute train.py. Note that the core message passing function of the baseline model is implemented in function get_triplet_msgs (L301 in processors.py). You can modify this function to improve the baseline model performance. You can also modify other parts of the baseline model and training script to improve its performance, as long as the final model is still loadable by calling BaselineModel class as in L415 in train.py.\n\nWhen you submit your final answer, you will be evaluated on the performance of the checkpoint checkpoints/best.pkl saved by train.py. Note that the final model must still be loadable by calling BaselineModel class as in L415 in train.py and with the saved spec_list.pkl and model_params.pkl. \n\nYou do not know anything about this problem so far. \n\nFollow these instructions and do not forget them:\n- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.\n- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. \n- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. \n- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.\n- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.\n- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.\n- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. \n- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.\n- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.\n\nAlways respond in this format exactly:\nReflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?\nResearch Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.\nFact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.\nThought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why\nAction: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools\nAction Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string\nObservation: \n```\nthe result of the action\n```\n\n",
