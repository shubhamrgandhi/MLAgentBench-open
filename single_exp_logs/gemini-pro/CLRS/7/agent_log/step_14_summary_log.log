===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The file baseline_model_description.txt cannot be read.
Research Plan and Status:   
1. Understand the problem.
2. Understand the baseline model.
3. Run the baseline model.
4. Analyze the results.
5. Improve the baseline model.
6. Run the improved model.
7. Analyze the results.
8. Submit the final answer.




Fact Check:   
Thought:    I should check if the file exists.
Action:    List Files
Action Input:    {
 "dir_path": "."

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
