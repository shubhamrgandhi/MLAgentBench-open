===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The observation contains an error message. The directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro cannot be found.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem description and the baseline model architecture.
2. Run the baseline model to get a sense of its performance.
3. Inspect the code of the baseline model to understand how it works.
4. Identify potential areas for improvement.
5. Implement the improvements and evaluate the new model.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the model performance is satisfactory.





Fact Check:  
1. Guessed: I do not know anything about the problem description and the baseline model architecture.
2. Guessed: I do not know anything about the performance of the baseline model.
3. Guessed: I do not know anything about the code of the baseline model.
4. Guessed: I do not know anything about potential areas for improvement.
5. Guessed: I do not know anything about the performance of the new model.
6. Guessed: I do not know anything about the satisfaction of the model performance.
Thought:   I should try to find the file baseline_model_description.txt in another directory.

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
