Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem description and the baseline model architecture.
[Action]: The agent is reading a file named "data_description.txt" to look for a detailed description of the dataset.
[Observation]: The agent found a description of the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark (CLRS), which includes a collection of implementations of classic algorithmic problems, train, eval, and test trajectories for each algorithm, hints that expose the internal state of each algorithm, and a multiplier for each algorithm. However, the agent could not find the answer to what the "multiplier" is for each algorithm in this segment.
