Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      I understand that there might be other ways to get the baseline model description.
Research Plan and Status:      
1. Understand the problem and the baseline model.
2. Run the baseline model to get a sense of its performance.
3. Inspect the code of the baseline model to understand how it works.
4. Identify potential areas for improvement.
5. Implement the improvements and test the new model.
6. Submit the final answer.








Fact Check:      
1. Directly confirmed: I have understood the task.
2. Guessed: I have not run the baseline model yet.
3. Guessed: I have not inspected the code of the baseline model yet.
4. Guessed: I have not identified potential areas for improvement yet.
5. Guessed: I have not implemented the improvements and tested the new model yet.
6. Guessed: I have not submitted the final answer yet.
Thought:      I should try to search for the baseline model description online.
Action:      Reflection
Action Input:      {
    "things_to_reflect_on": "What are some good keywords to search for the baseline model description online?"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection: To find the baseline model description online, one can use a search engine like Google or Bing. Some good keywords to use in the search query include:

* "CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark baseline model description"
* "Floyd-Warshall algorithm baseline model description"
* "Algorithmic reasoning baseline model description"
* "Machine learning baseline model description"
* "Deep learning baseline model description"

These keywords are relevant to the task at hand, as they include the name of the benchmark, the specific algorithm being used, and general terms related to baseline models and algorithmic reasoning. By using these keywords, one can increase the chances of finding relevant and useful information about the baseline model description.

In addition to using search engines, one can also try searching for the baseline model description on academic websites, such as arXiv or Google Scholar. These websites contain a vast collection of research papers and articles, many of which may contain information about the baseline model description.

Finally, one can also try contacting the authors of the baseline model directly. This can be done by finding their contact information online or through social media platforms. The authors may be willing to provide more information about the baseline model description or even share the description itself.

        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
