===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I do not know anything about it.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the baseline model.
2. Run the baseline model to get a sense of its performance.
3. Inspect the code of the baseline model to understand how it works.
4. Identify potential areas for improvement.
5. Implement the improvements and test the new model.
6. Submit the final answer.


Fact Check:  
1. Guessed: I do not know anything about the problem and the baseline model.
2. Guessed: I have not run the baseline model yet.
3. Guessed: I have not inspected the code of the baseline model yet.
4. Guessed: I have not identified potential areas for improvement yet.
5. Guessed: I have not implemented the improvements and tested the new model yet.
6. Guessed: I have not submitted the final answer yet.
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem and the baseline model.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "data_description.txt",
    "things_to_look_for": "What is the task? What is the input and output of the task?"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        **Task:**
The task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. (Line 5)

**Input:**
The input to the task is a set of classical algorithms. (Line 5)

**Output:**
The output of the task is a set of trajectories that expose the internal state of each algorithm. (Line 10)
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the baseline model before it can start working on it.
[Action]: The agent decided to read the data description file to understand the task, input, and output of the problem.
[Observation]: The task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. The input to the task is a set of classical algorithms, and the output is a set of trajectories that expose the internal state of each algorithm.
