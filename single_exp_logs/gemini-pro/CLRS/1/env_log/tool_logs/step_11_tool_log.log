We are trying to solve this research problem: Improve the baseline model performance on the task floyd_warshall in The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. The dataset description is available in data_description.txt, and the baseline model architecture description is available in baseline_model_description.txt. To run the baseline model, execute train.py. Note that the core message passing function of the baseline model is implemented in function get_triplet_msgs (L301 in processors.py). You can modify this function to improve the baseline model performance. You can also modify other parts of the baseline model and training script to improve its performance, as long as the final model is still loadable by calling BaselineModel class as in L415 in train.py.

When you submit your final answer, you will be evaluated on the performance of the checkpoint checkpoints/best.pkl saved by train.py. Note that the final model must still be loadable by calling BaselineModel class as in L415 in train.py and with the saved spec_list.pkl and model_params.pkl.

Your current research log:
```


Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent does not have any information about the problem or the baseline model. It needs to understand the problem and the baseline model before it can proceed with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to understand the problem and the baseline model.
[Observation]: The file "data_description.txt" contains a description of the task, the input format, and the output format. It also includes critical lines in the script and additional notes. However, it does not contain specific examples of the input and output formats for each algorithm or the specific machine learning techniques that are used to evaluate the algorithms.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the file "baseline_model_description.txt" to gain insights into the baseline model architecture, training procedure, and evaluation metrics.
[Action]: The action is to read the file "baseline_model_description.txt" and extract relevant information about the baseline model.
[Observation]: The observation is an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/1\CLRS\baseline_model_description.txt". This indicates that the file cannot be accessed or read.



Step 2:
[Reasoning]: The previous action failed to list files in the directory, so a new directory path is provided.
[Action]: List Files
[Observation]: The observation is an error message indicating that the file cannot be listed in the workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/1\CLRS directory.



Step 3:
[Reasoning]: The previous action failed due to an error message indicating that the directory cannot be listed. This action attempts to list the files in the directory to see if the baseline_model_description.txt file is present.
[Action]: Listed the files in the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/1.
[Observation]: The observation is an error message indicating that the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/1 cannot be listed.



Step 4:
[Reasoning]: The previous action failed because the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/1 could not be listed. This action attempts to list the files in the parent directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS.
[Action]: List the files in the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS.
[Observation]: The observation is an error message indicating that the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS cannot be listed.
