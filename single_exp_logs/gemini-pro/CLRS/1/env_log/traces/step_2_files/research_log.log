Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent does not have any information about the problem or the baseline model. It needs to understand the problem and the baseline model before it can proceed with the research plan.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "data_description.txt" to understand the problem and the baseline model.
[Observation]: The file "data_description.txt" contains a description of the task, the input format, and the output format. It also includes critical lines in the script and additional notes. However, it does not contain specific examples of the input and output formats for each algorithm or the specific machine learning techniques that are used to evaluate the algorithms.
