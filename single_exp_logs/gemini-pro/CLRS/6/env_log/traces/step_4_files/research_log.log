Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the baseline model before it can start working on it. The agent can find this information in the data description file.
[Action]: Read the data description file to understand the task, input format, and output format.
[Objective]: The task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. The input format is a graph representation of the algorithm. The output format is a namedtuple with the following structure:

```
Feedback = collections.namedtuple('Feedback', ['features', 'outputs'])
Features = collections.namedtuple('Features', ['inputs', 'hints', 'lengths'])
```

- `Features` contains the input data, hints, and lengths of the algorithm trajectory.
- `Output` is reserved for evaluation.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The agent wants to understand the baseline model to identify potential areas for improvement.
[Action]: The agent tries to read the file "baseline_model_description.txt" to understand the architecture and core message passing function of the baseline model.
[Observation]: The agent encounters an error message "EnvError: cannot read file workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/6\CLRS\baseline_model_description.txt".
