===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  This is the first time I am seeing this problem. I do not know anything about it.
Research Plan and Status:  
1. Understand the problem and the baseline model.
2. Run the baseline model to get a sense of its performance.
3. Inspect the code of the baseline model to understand how it works.
4. Identify potential areas for improvement.
5. Implement the improvements and evaluate the new model.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until satisfied with the results.


Fact Check:  
1. Guessed: I do not know anything about the problem and the baseline model.
2. Guessed: I have not run the baseline model yet.
3. Guessed: I have not inspected the code of the baseline model yet.
4. Guessed: I have not identified potential areas for improvement yet.
5. Guessed: I have not implemented any improvements yet.
6. Guessed: I have not evaluated the new model yet.
Thought:  I should start by understanding the problem and the baseline model.
Action:  Understand File
Action Input:  {
    "file_name": "data_description.txt",
    "things_to_look_for": "What is the task? What is the input and output format?"
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        **Task:**
The task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. (Line 5)

**Input Format:**
The input format is a graph representation of the algorithm. (Line 16)
- For objects that obey a more strict ordered structure (e.g. arrays or rooted trees), the ordering is imposed through inclusion of predecessor links. (Line 18)

**Output Format:**
The output format is a namedtuple with the following structure: (Line 29)

```
Feedback = collections.namedtuple('Feedback', ['features', 'outputs'])
Features = collections.namedtuple('Features', ['inputs', 'hints', 'lengths'])
```

- `Features` contains the input data, hints, and lengths of the algorithm trajectory. (Line 31)
- `Outputs` is reserved for evaluation. (Line 32)
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the baseline model before it can start working on it. The agent can find this information in the data description file.
[Action]: Read the data description file to understand the task, input format, and output format.
[Objective]: The task is to evaluate algorithmic reasoning by providing a suite of implementations of classical algorithms. The input format is a graph representation of the algorithm. The output format is a namedtuple with the following structure:

```
Feedback = collections.namedtuple('Feedback', ['features', 'outputs'])
Features = collections.namedtuple('Features', ['inputs', 'hints', 'lengths'])
```

- `Features` contains the input data, hints, and lengths of the algorithm trajectory.
- `Output` is reserved for evaluation.
