===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The file baseline_model_description.txt does not exist.
Research Plan and Status:    
1. Understand the problem and the baseline model.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement.
3. Design and implement experiments to evaluate the improvements.
4. Analyze the results and draw conclusions.




Fact Check:    
1. Directly confirmed: The task is to improve the performance of the baseline model on the floyd_warshall task in The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark.
2. Directly confirmed: The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark is a suite of implementations of classical algorithms from the third edition of the standard Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
Thought:    I should check if the file exists in another location.
Action:    List Files
Action Input:    {
    "dir_path": "workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: Cannot list file in the workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/ directory
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The file baseline_model_description.txt does not exist in the current directory. I should check if the file exists in another location.
[Action]: List all files in the directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/.
[Observation]: The action failed with the error message "Cannot list file in the workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/ directory".
