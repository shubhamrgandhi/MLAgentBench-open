===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The directory workspaces/single_exp_logs/gemini-pro/CLRS/ does not exist.
Research Plan and Status:     
1. Understand the problem and the baseline model.
2. Identify potential areas for improvement.
3. Design and implement experiments to evaluate the improvements.
4. Analyze the results and draw conclusions.






Fact Check:     
1. Directly confirmed: The task is to improve the performance of the baseline model on the floyd_warshall task in The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark.
2. Directly confirmed: The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark is a suite of implementations of classical algorithms from the third edition of the standard Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
Thought:     I cannot proceed without the baseline model description. I should ask for help.
Action:     Final Answer
Action Input:     {
    "final_answer": "I cannot proceed without the baseline model description."
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        end
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The task is to improve the performance of the baseline model on the floyd_warshall task in The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. However, the baseline model description is not provided.
[Action]: The assistant provides a final answer: "I cannot proceed without the baseline model description."
[Observation]: The assistant provides a final answer: "I cannot proceed without the baseline model description."
