Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent needs to understand the problem and the baseline model in more detail.
[Action]: The agent wants to understand the file data_description.txt and look for information about the task.
[Observation]: The task is to create a benchmark for evaluating algorithmic reasoning, specifically focusing on classical algorithms from the third edition of the standard Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: The action is to understand the baseline model in more detail. The observation is that the file "baseline_model_description.txt" cannot be read.
[Action]: The action is to understand the baseline model in more detail. The input to the action is to look for the architecture of the baseline model in the file "baseline_model_description.txt".
[Observation]: The observation is that the file "baseline_model_description.txt" cannot be read.
