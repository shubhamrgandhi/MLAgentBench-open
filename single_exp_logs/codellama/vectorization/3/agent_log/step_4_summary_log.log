<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    I have tried to improve the execution speed by using only the numpy library and vectorization in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123. However, I am not sure if the edit is correct and desirable.
Research Plan and Status:    
* High Level Plan:
	+ Understand the train.py script to identify potential areas for improvement.
	+ Identify the current execution speed of the script.
	+ Try to improve the execution speed by using only the numpy library and vectorization in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123.
	+ Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.
* Current Status:
	+ Identified potential areas for improvement.
	+ Recorded the execution time of the script.
	+ Edited the script to vectorize the forward pass.
