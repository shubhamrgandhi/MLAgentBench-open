        Reflection:   I have tried to improve the execution speed by using only the numpy library and vectorization in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123. However, I realized that my attempt at vectorization was incorrect and did not improve performance.
Research Plan and Status:  
* High Level Plan:
	+ Understand the train.py script to identify potential areas for improvement.
	+ Identify the current execution speed of the script.
	+ Try to improve the execution speed by using only the numpy library and vectorization in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123.
	+ Store the run time in a submission.csv as shown in train.py.
* Current Status:
	+ Identified potential areas for improvement.
	+ Recorded the execution time of the script.
	+ Attempted to improve the execution speed by using only the numpy library and vectorization in the forward function for lines from 105 to 123, but the attempt was unsuccessful.













Fact Check:

  Reasoning: To improve the execution speed of the script, it is necessary to reduce the number of computations in the convolution step. Strides can be used to achieve this goal by reducing the number of elements that are processed in each iteration.

Action: Edited the script to use strides in the convolution step. Specifically, added the stride parameter to the np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided() function call on line 141, which allows for the creation of a view into the input array with a custom stride. This reduces the number of computations required in the convolution step.
