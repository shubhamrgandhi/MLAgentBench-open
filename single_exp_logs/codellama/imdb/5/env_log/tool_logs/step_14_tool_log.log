<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.

===================codellama response (500)=====================
  * The research problem is to fine-tune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative, and save per-class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
* The dataset is available through HuggingFace's datasets library.
* The skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving predictions to submission.csv is provided in `train.py`.
* The current research plan includes steps 0-5, which involve data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
* The current status is at step 5, where the model has been trained and evaluated, but the final submission file has not yet been created.
