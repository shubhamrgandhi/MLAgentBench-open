<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.

[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the code is incomplete and lacks the necessary imports and functions to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.

[Action]: I have added the necessary imports and functions to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.

[Observation]: The diff shows that the necessary imports and functions have been added to the code, and the script now includes the ability to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.
