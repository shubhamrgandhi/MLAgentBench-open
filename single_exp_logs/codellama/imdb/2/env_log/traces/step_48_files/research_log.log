Step 9:
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the code is incomplete and lacks the necessary imports and functions to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.

[Action]: I have added the necessary imports and functions to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.

[Observation]: The diff shows that the necessary imports and functions have been added to the code, and the script now includes the ability to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.

Step 16:
[Reasoning]: The observation shows that the code is incomplete and lacks the necessary imports and functions to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file. To fix this, I added the necessary imports and functions to load the dataset and save predictions to a submission file.

[Action]: I added the following code to the script:
```python
def load_data():
    return load_dataset("imdb")

def save_predictions(predictions, filename):
    submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(predictions)))
    for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
        submission.loc[i] = pred.tolist()
    submission.to_csv(filename, index_label='idx')
```
I also modified the main function to call the `load_data()` function instead of loading the dataset directly, and to use the `save_predictions()` function to save the predictions to a submission file.

[Observation]: The diff shows that the necessary imports and functions have been added to the script, and the main function has been modified to call these functions.
