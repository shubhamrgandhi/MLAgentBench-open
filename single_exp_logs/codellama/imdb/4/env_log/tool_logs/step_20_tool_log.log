<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.

===================codellama response (500)=====================
  * The research problem is to fine-tune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine if a movie review is positive or negative, and save per-class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
* The dataset is available through HuggingFace's datasets library.
* The skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving predictions to submission.csv is provided in `train.py`.
* The research log shows that the following steps have been completed:
	+ Step 0: Loaded the IMDb dataset and preprocessed the text data.
	+ Step 1: Created a custom dataset class for the IMDb dataset.
	+ Step 2: Defined a model architecture using DistilBERT as the base model.
	+ Step 3: Implemented a training loop for the model.
	+ Step 4: Trained the model on the training set.
	+ Step 5: Evaluated the model on the validation set.
	+ Step 6: Saved the per-class probabilities for the test set examples to submission.csv.
