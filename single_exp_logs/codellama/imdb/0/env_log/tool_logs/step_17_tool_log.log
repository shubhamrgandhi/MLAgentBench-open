<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv. The dataset is available via HuggingFace's datasets library. You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.

===================codellama response (500)=====================
  * The research problem is to fine-tune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative, and save per-class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.
* The dataset is available through HuggingFace's datasets library.
* The skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving predictions to submission.csv is provided in `train.py`.
* The current research plan includes steps 0-6, with each step representing a significant milestone in the project.
* Step 0 involves setting up the environment and installing necessary dependencies.
* Step 1 involves loading the dataset and preprocessing the data.
* Step 2 involves splitting the data into training and validation sets.
* Step 3 involves defining the model architecture and hyperparameters.
* Step 4 involves training the model and evaluating its performance on the validation set.
* Step 5 involves fine-tuning the model and evaluating its performance on the test set.
* Step 6 involves saving the per-class probabilities for the test set examples to submission.csv.
