Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        ActionInputParsingError: Extra data: line 3 column 1 (char 38)
The action input for Understand File needs to be a valid json with proper entries. You may have missed the comma between entries or used triple quotes (json does not recognizes triple quotes). Please use the correct format and try again:
{
            file_name: [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed],
            things_to_look_for: [a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned]
}
        ```

  Reasoning: The user is trying to understand the contents of the file "task_descriptor.txt" using the "Understand File" action.

Action: The user has provided the following action input: {"file_name": "task_descriptor.txt"}. However, the input is not in the correct JSON format, which is required for the "Understand File" action. Specifically, there is an extra data entry at line 3 column 1 (char 38), which is causing the error.
