Step 0:
[Reasoning]: To list the files in the current directory.
[Action]: List Files action was performed with input {"dir_path": "."}.
[Observation]: The following files were listed: backup/, data/, train.py.



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: To better understand the purpose and functionality of the `train.py` script, I need to inspect its code.
[Action]: I inspected the lines of the `train.py` script from line 1 to line 100.
[Observation]: The script imports necessary libraries, defines a neural network model, loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, defines the dataloaders, optimizer, and loss function, trains the model for 5 epochs, and prints the training and test accuracies. It also saves the predictions to a CSV file named `submission.csv`.
