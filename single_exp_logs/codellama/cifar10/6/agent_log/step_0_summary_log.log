===================prompt=====================
<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  I am starting to work on the given problem.
Research Plan and Status: 
* High Level Plan:
	+ Step 1: Understand the problem and the given training script.
	+ Step 2: Experiment with different hyperparameters to see if there is any improvement in performance.
	+ Step 3: If there is no improvement, try other approaches such as feature engineering or using a different model.
* Current Status:
	+ Step 1: Done.
	+ Step 2: In progress.
* Results and Conclusions:
	+ Step 1: The training script trains a model on the given dataset and saves the per-class probabilities for the test set examples to submission.csv.



Fact Check: 

* All objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status are directly confirmed by the previous observation.

Thought:  I am currently working on step 2 of the high level plan, which is to experiment with different hyperparameters to see if there is any improvement in performance.
