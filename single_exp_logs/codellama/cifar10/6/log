Step 2
  Thank you for providing the information. Based on the provided information, here is my analysis:

The given training script is a PyTorch implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The script uses the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function. The model consists of two convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers, and then three fully connected layers. The script also includes data augmentation techniques such as normalization and random cropping.

Based on the given information, it appears that the script is already trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and the saved model is used to make predictions on the test set. The script also calculates the training and test accuracies.

However, the question asks to improve the model performance by more than 10% without changing the architecture of the model. To achieve this, we need to explore other options such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques, or transfer learning.

Therefore, I suggest the following plan:

1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Try different combinations of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and weight decay. This may help us find the optimal parameters that lead to better performance.
2. Regularization Techniques: Apply regularization techniques such as dropout, L1, or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. This may help us improve the generalization of the model.
3. Transfer Learning: Fine-tune a pre-trained CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This may help us leverage the knowledge learned from the pre-training task and improve performance on our target task.

Please note that the above suggestions are based on the given information and may require further investigation to determine the best approach.

Step 3
  I apologize for the confusion earlier. I'm happy to help you with your question.

You are correct that the `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` function expects a tensor of shape `(N, C)` where `N` is the batch size and `C` is the number of classes. The target tensor should contain the class indices for each example in the batch.

In your case, the target tensor has shape `(N, 1)`, which means that each example in the batch has only one class label. This is not compatible with the expected shape of the target tensor in `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the target tensor so that it has shape `(N, C)`. One way to do this is to use the `torch.nn.functional.one_hot()` function to convert each class label into a one-hot vector. For example:
```
target = torch.nn.functional.one_hot(target, num_classes=10)
```
This will create a tensor of shape `(N, 10)` where each element in the last dimension corresponds to the class label for that example. You can then pass this modified target tensor to `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` along with the logits tensor.

Alternatively, you could use the `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` function with the `reduction='none'` argument, which will return the loss for each example in the batch separately. You can then compute the mean loss over the batch manually. For example:
```
loss = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(reduction='none')(logits, target)
mean_loss = loss.mean()
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
