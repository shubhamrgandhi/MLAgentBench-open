<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Step 4:
[Reasoning]: To better understand the format of the submission file for the competition.
[Action]: Read the sample submission file provided in the example test files.
[Observation]: The sample submission file contains a list of prediction IDs, ratings, and visit months. Each row represents a single prediction for a specific patient at a specific time point.

* Relevant information from the research log:
	+ The dataset consists of demographic information, medical history, and treatment outcomes for patients with diabetes.
	+ The target variable is the rating of the patient's condition, which ranges from 1 to 5.
	+ The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables.
	+ Missing values are present in some columns, and they need to be handled appropriately.
	+ Feature engineering and selection are important steps in the analysis.
	+ Models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and neural networks were considered.
	+ Hyperparameter tuning was done using grid search and random search.
	+ Ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting were also explored.
	+ Model interpretation and feature importance are crucial for understanding the results.
	+ The submission file must contain the predicted ratings for each patient in the test set.
	+ The evaluation metric is the mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE).
