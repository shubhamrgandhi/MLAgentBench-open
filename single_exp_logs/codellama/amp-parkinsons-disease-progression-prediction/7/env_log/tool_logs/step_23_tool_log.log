<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

Step 4:
[Reasoning]: To better understand the format of the submission file for the competition.
[Action]: Read the sample submission file provided in the example test files.
[Observation]: The sample submission file contains a list of prediction IDs, ratings, and visit months. Each row represents a single prediction for a specific patient at a specific time point.

	+ Step 3: Training a baseline model and evaluating its performance.
	+ Step 4: Reading the sample submission file to understand the format of the output.
	+ Step 5: Iterating over different models and feature selections to improve performance.
	+ Step 6: Evaluating the performance of the best model on the test set.
	+ Step 7: Submitting the predictions of the best model as a submission.csv file.
* Observations from the research log:
	+ The data consists of demographic information, medical history, and treatment outcomes for patients with diabetes.
	+ The target variable is the rating of the patient's condition, which ranges from 0 to 100.
	+ The dataset includes both categorical and numerical variables.
	+ The sample submission file contains a list of prediction IDs, ratings, and visit months.
	+ The goal is to predict the rating of each patient's condition based on their medical history and treatment outcomes.
