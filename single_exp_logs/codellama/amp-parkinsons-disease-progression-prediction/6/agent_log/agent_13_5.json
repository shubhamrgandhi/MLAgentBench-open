The number of lines to display is limited to 100 lines. This is especially helpful when debugging.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Inspect Script Lines\n        Action Input: {\n            \"script_name\": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed],\n            \"start_line_number\": [a valid line number],\n            \"end_line_number\": [a valid line number]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script between start_line_number and end_line_number . If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]\n        ```\n\n- Edit Script (AI):\n        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script. Instead of editing the script directly, you should describe the edit instruction so that another AI can help you do this.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Edit Script (AI)\n        Action Input: {\n            \"script_name\": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed. An empty sctipt will be created if it does not exist.],\n            \"edit_instruction\": [a detailed step by step description on how to edit it.],\n            \"save_name\": [a valid file name with relative path to current directory if needed]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be the edited content of the script. If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]\n        ```\n\n- Reflection:\n        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Reflection\n        Action Input: {\n            \"things_to_reflect_on\": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]\n        ```\n\n\n\nResearch Problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.\nThen fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.\nNever try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance. \n\nYou do not know anything about this problem so far. \n\nFollow these instructions and do not forget them:\n- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.\n- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. \n- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. \n- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.\n- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.\n- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.\n- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. \n- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.\n- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.\n\nAlways respond in this format exactly:\nReflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?\nResearch Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.\nFact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above. Performance numbers can only be confirmed by running the code and observing the output.\nThought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why\nAction: the action to take, should be one of the names of the tools\nAction Input: the input to the action as a valid JSON string\nObservation: \n```\nthe result of the action\n```\n\n",

The complete set of proteins involved in PD remains an open research question and any proteins that have predictive value are likely worth investigating further. The core of the dataset consists of protein abundance values derived from mass spectrometry readings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gathered from several hundred patients. Each patient contributed several samples over the course of multiple years while they also took assessments of PD severity.\n\nThis is a time-series code competition: you will receive test set data and make predictions with a time-series API. See the evaluation_details.txt for details.\n\nFiles\ntrain_peptides.csv Mass spectrometry data at the peptide level. Peptides are the component subunits of proteins.\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nUniProt - The UniProt ID code for the associated protein. There are often several peptides per protein.\nPeptide - The sequence of amino acids included in the peptide. See this table for the relevant codes. Some rare annotations may not be included in the table. The test set may include peptides not found in the train set.\nPeptideAbundance - The frequency of the amino acid in the sample.\ntrain_proteins.csv Protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data.\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nUniProt - The UniProt ID code for the associated protein. There are often several peptides per protein. The test set may include proteins not found in the train set.\nNPX - Normalized protein expression. The frequency of the protein's occurrence in the sample. May not have a 1:1 relationship with the component peptides as some proteins contain repeated copies of a given peptide.\ntrain_clinical_data.csv\n\nvisit_id - ID code for the visit.\nvisit_month - The month of the visit, relative to the first visit by the patient.\npatient_id - An ID code for the patient.\nupdrs_[1-4] - The patient's score for part N of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Higher numbers indicate more severe symptoms. Each sub-section covers a distinct category of symptoms, such as mood and behavior for Part 1 and motor functions for Part 3.\nupd23b_clinical_state_on_medication - Whether or not the patient was taking medication such as Levodopa during the UPDRS assessment. Expected to mainly affect the scores for Part 3 (motor function). These medications wear off fairly quickly (on the order of one day) so it's common for patients to take the motor function exam twice in a single month, both with and without medication.\nsupplemental_clinical_data.csv Clinical records without any associated CSF samples. This data is intended to provide additional context about the typical progression of Parkinsons. Uses the same columns as train_clinical_data.csv.\n\nexample_test_files/ Data intended to illustrate how the API functions.
