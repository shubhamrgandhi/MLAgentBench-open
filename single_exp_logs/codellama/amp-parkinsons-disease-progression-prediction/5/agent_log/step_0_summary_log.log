<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  I am starting my research on the given problem.
Research Plan and Status: 
* High level plan:
	+ Understand the problem and the data
	+ Experiment with different models and features to improve performance
	+ Train a model and make predictions for the test set
	+ Submit the predictions as a submission.csv file
* Current status:
	+ No progress yet
* Results and conclusions:
	+ None



Fact Check: 

* All statements in the current Research Plan and Status are guessed.
