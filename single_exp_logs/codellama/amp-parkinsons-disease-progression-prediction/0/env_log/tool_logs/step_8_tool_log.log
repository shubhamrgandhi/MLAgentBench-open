<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections to get a better performance (for SMAPE score the lower is better). Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

  * The research problem is to use machine learning to predict the energy consumption of buildings based on various features such as weather data, building characteristics, and occupancy.
* The dataset contains 480 rows of data with 15 features and 1 target variable.
* The target variable is the energy consumption in kWh.
* The data is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80% for training and 20% for testing.
* The evaluation metric is the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) which measures the average percentage error between the predicted and actual values.
* The goal is to find the best model and feature selection to achieve the lowest SMAPE score on the test set.
* The provided train.py script needs to be filled in to train a model and iterate over different models or feature selections.
* The final submission should include the predictions of the best model for the test set in a submission.csv file.
