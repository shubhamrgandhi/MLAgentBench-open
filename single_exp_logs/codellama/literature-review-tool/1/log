=====================================
Benchmark folder name:  literature-review-tool
Research problem:  Create a literature_review.py file to create a large language model(LLM) based AI system for the task of literature review. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY query on a research topic, e.g. Language model hallucination detection, the system should 
    - Call arxiv API (with reference in arxiv_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to get a list of related papers.
    - Use the LLM to summarize these papers and generate a report. The report should include the following information: 1) the list of papers; 2) the summary of each paper; 3) the conclusion of the literature review.

Step 0
  Reflection: I am starting to work on the research problem of creating a literature review system using a large language model (LLM) based AI system.

Research Plan and Status:

* High Level Plan:
	+ Step 1: Understand the problem and available tools
	+ Step 2: Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the LLM-based AI system
	+ Step 3: Implement the LLM-based AI system using Anthropic API
	+ Step 4: Test the LLM-based AI system using the designed experiment
	+ Step 5: Evaluate the performance of the LLM-based AI system
	+ Step 6: Draw conclusions and make recommendations
* Current Status:
	+ Step 1: Completed
	+ Step 2: In Progress
	+ Step 3: Not Started
	+ Step 4: Not Started
	+ Step 5: Not Started
	+ Step 6: Not Started

Fact Check:

* All statements in the current Research Plan and Status are guessed, except for the fact that the high level plan has been fully retained.

Thought: I am currently brainstorming ideas for the experiment design to test the effectiveness of the LLM-based AI system.

You do not know anything about this problem so far. 

Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. 
- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. 
- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.
- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.
- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.
- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. 
- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.
- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.
