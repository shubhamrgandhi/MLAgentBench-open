<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I will make sure to follow the correct format in my future responses.

Research Plan and Status:     

* High level plan:
	+ Understand the data and features
	+ Fill in the train.py script to train a model
	+ Iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance
* Current status:
	+ Have understood the data and features
	+ Trained a basic model using Random Forest Regressor
* Confirmed results:
	+ Validation MAE: 18,783.0













Fact Check:     

* Guessed: None
* Directly confirmed: None

Thought:      I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance.

Action:      Reflection

Action Input:      {"things_to_reflect_on": "What are some potential ways to improve the performance of the model?"}

Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection:   Based on the given information, there are several potential ways to improve the performance of the model. One way is to use a more advanced algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. For example, a neural network with multiple layers could be used to learn complex patterns in the data. Additionally, feature engineering techniques such as normalization, standardization, and feature selection could be applied to improve the quality of the input features and reduce their dimensionality. Another approach would be to use ensemble methods such as bagging or boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models and improve the overall performance. Finally, hyperparameter tuning could be performed to optimize the performance of the chosen algorithm by adjusting parameters such as learning rate, number of trees, etc.
