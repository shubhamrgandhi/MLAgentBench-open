        Reflection:   Based on the information provided in the research log, it appears that the model's performance could be improved by exploring different algorithms and feature selection techniques. Here are some potential ways to enhance the model's performance:

1. Algorithm selection: The current implementation uses the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, which is a popular choice for regression tasks. However, there may be other algorithms that could perform better on this specific dataset. For example, one could try using gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, or neural networks to compare their performance.
2. Feature engineering: The current implementation uses all available features from the dataset without any preprocessing or feature selection. It would be beneficial to explore different feature selection techniques, such as correlation analysis, mutual information, or recursive feature elimination, to identify the most relevant features for the model. Additionally, one could try transforming the features using techniques like normalization, standardization, or
