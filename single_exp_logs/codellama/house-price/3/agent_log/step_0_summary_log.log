<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  I am starting to work on the research problem.
Research Plan and Status: 
* High level plan:
	+ Understand the data and features
	+ Fill in the train.py script to train a model
	+ Iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance
* Current status:
	+ Have not started working on the problem yet
	+ No confirmed results yet
* Confirmed results:
	+ None



Fact Check: 

* Guessed: None
* Directly confirmed: None

Thought:  I need to understand the data and features first.
