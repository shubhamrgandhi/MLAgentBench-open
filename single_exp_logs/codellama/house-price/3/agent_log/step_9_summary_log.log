<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I will make sure to follow the correct format in my future responses.

Research Plan and Status: 

* High level plan:
	+ Understand the data and features
	+ Fill in the train.py script to train a model
	+ Iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance
* Current status:
	+ Have understood the data and features
	+ Trained a basic model using Random Forest Regressor
* Confirmed results:
	+ Validation MAE: 18,783.0









Fact Check: 

* Guessed: None
* Directly confirmed: None

Thought:  I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance.

Action:  Reflection

Action Input:  {"things_to_reflect_on": "What are some potential ways to improve the performance of the model?"}

Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection:   Based on the given information, there are several potential ways to improve the performance of the model. One way is to use a more advanced algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. For example, a neural network with multiple layers could be used to learn complex patterns in the data. Another way is to engineer new features that capture important information about the data. For example, if the data contains information about the location of the property, a new feature could be created that represents the distance from the property to the nearest amenity such as a grocery store or school. Additionally, it may be helpful to explore different hyperparameters for the random forest regressor, such as the number of trees in the forest or the maximum depth of each tree, to see if these parameters have a significant impact on the model's performance. Finally, it may be worth considering other evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error or R-squared, to gain a more complete understanding of the model's performance.
