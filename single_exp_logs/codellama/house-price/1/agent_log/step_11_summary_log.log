        Reflection:    I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I will make sure to follow the correct format in my future responses.

Research Plan and Status:    

* High level plan:
	+ Understand the data and features
	+ Fill in the train.py script to train a model
	+ Iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance
* Current status:
	+ Have understood the data and features
	+ Trained a basic model using Random Forest Regressor
* Confirmed results:
	+ Validation MAE: 18,783.0











Fact Check:    

* Guessed: None
* Directly confirmed: None

Thought:     I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance.

Action:     Reflection

Action Input:     {"things_to_reflect_on": "What are some potential ways to improve the performance of the model?"}

Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection:   Based on the given information, there are several potential ways to improve the performance of the model. One way is to use a more advanced algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. For example, a neural network or a decision tree ensemble could be used instead of a random forest regressor. Additionally, feature engineering techniques such as normalization, standardization, or transformation could be applied to the data to create new features that may capture more relevant information for the model. Another approach is to use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data, which can provide a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization ability. Finally, hyperparameter tuning can also be performed to optimize the model's performance by adjusting parameters such as the number of trees, the maximum depth of the tree, or the learning rate.
