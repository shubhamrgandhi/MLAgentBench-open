<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:      I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I will make sure to follow the correct format in my future responses.

Research Plan and Status:      

* High level plan:
	+ Understand the data and features
	+ Fill in the train.py script to train a model
	+ Iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance
* Current status:
	+ Have understood the data and features
	+ Trained a basic model using Random Forest Regressor
* Confirmed results:
	+ Validation MAE: 18,783.0


















Fact Check:      

* Guessed: None
* Directly confirmed: None

Thought:       I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance.

Action:       Reflection

Action Input:       {"things_to_reflect_on": "What are some potential ways to improve the performance of the model?"}

Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection:   Based on the given information, there are several potential ways to improve the performance of the model. One way is to use a more advanced machine learning algorithm that can handle complex relationships between variables. For example, a neural network with multiple layers could be used to learn non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. Additionally, feature engineering techniques such as PCA or feature selection could be applied to identify the most relevant features for the model, which could also improve its performance. Another potential improvement is to use a larger dataset that includes more examples, which would allow the model to generalize better to new, unseen data. Finally, hyperparameter tuning could be performed to optimize the model's performance by adjusting parameters such as the number of trees in the random forest or the learning rate of the neural network.
