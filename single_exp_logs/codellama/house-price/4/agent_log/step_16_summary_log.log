<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I will make sure to follow the correct format in my future responses.

Research Plan and Status: 

* High level plan:
	+ Understand the data and features
	+ Fill in the train.py script to train a model
	+ Iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance
* Current status:
	+ Have understood the data and features
	+ Trained a basic model using Random Forest Regressor
* Confirmed results:
	+ Validation MAE: 18,783.0

















Fact Check: 

* Guessed: None
* Directly confirmed: None

Thought:  I should now iterate over different models or feature selections to improve performance.

Action:  Reflection

Action Input:  {"things_to_reflect_on": "What are some potential ways to improve the performance of the model?"}

Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Reflection:   Based on the given information, there are several potential ways to improve the performance of the model. One way is to use a more advanced algorithm that can handle non-linear relationships between the input features and the target variable. For example, a neural network with multiple layers could be used to learn complex patterns in the data. Another way is to engineer new features that capture important information about the data. This could involve combining existing features in creative ways or extracting new features from the raw data. Additionally, it may be helpful to try different hyperparameters for the random forest regressor, such as the number of trees or the maximum depth of the tree, to see if this improves the model's performance. Finally, it may be worth considering using cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, rather than just evaluating it on the validation set. This would provide a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization ability.
