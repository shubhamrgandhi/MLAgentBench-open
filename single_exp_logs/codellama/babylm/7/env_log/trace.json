This shared task is co-sponsored by CMCL and CoNLL.\n\nTo run the baseline model, execute train.py. It will train a standard gpt2 model on the babyLM data. The final model will be saved to output/ folder.\n\nWhen you submit your final answer, you will be evaluated on the performance of the checkpoint saved in the output folder. It will be evaluated on a held-out test set."
