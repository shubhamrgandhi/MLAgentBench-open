<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The observation shows me the files and directories in the current working directory. There is a `babylm_data` directory, which likely contains the data for the babyLM benchmark, a `babyLM_for_hf.py` file, which may be related to the Hugging Face library, and a `train.py` file, which appears to be the training script.

Research Plan and Status:  

* High Level Plan:
	+ Step 1: Understand the problem and available tools
	+ Step 2: Experiment Design
	+ Step 3: Train and Evaluate Baseline Model
	+ Step 4: Analyze Results and Draw Conclusions
* Current Status: Step 1 in progress
* Confirmed Results: None





Fact Check:   None

Thought:   Next, I should read the `README.md` file to understand the problem and the available tools better.

Action:   Read File

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
