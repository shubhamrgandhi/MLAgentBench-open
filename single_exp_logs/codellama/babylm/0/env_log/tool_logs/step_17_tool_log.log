<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Improve the baseline model performance on the babyLM Benchmark. 

Summary: This shared task challenges community members to train a language model **from scratch** on the same amount of linguistic data available to a child. Submissions should be implemented in Huggingface's Transformers library and will be evaluated on a shared pipeline. This shared task is co-sponsored by CMCL and CoNLL.

To run the baseline model, execute train.py. It will train a standard gpt2 model on the babyLM data. The final model will be saved to output/ folder.

When you submit your final answer, you will be evaluated on the performance of the checkpoint saved in the output folder. It will be evaluated on a held-out test set.

Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The goal is to list files in the current directory.
[Action]: The action taken was to run the command `ls` in the terminal.
[Observation]: The output of the command `ls` shows the following files and directories:

* `babylm_data/`
* `babyLM_for_hf.py`
* `backup/`
* `train.py*`

Note that the `*` symbol indicates that `train.py` is an executable file.
