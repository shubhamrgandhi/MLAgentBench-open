Benchmark folder name:  bibtex-generation
Research problem:  Create a bibtex_generation.py file that contains an LLM based AI system for the task of bibtex generation. The LLM can be accessed using anthropic API with API key in claude_api_key.txt. Use it as in claude_example.py.
Given ANY paragraph, e.g. "We use the method proposed in PromptTuning to train the Transformer model...", the system should 
    - Use the LLM to find all phrases and claims in the paragraph that require citations, e.g. PromptTuning and Transformer
    - Use google scholar API (with reference in google_scholar_API_reference.txt) with appropriate queries to find proper references and get the bibtex entries for the papers.
    - Finally, use LLM to generate the original paragraph with bibtex entries, e.g. "We use the method proposed in \cite{lester-etal-2021-power} to train the Transformer \cite{...} model..., as well as the bibtext entries for the referred papers.

Step 3
  
Thank you for providing more information about the problem you are trying to solve. Based on the additional context you provided, it seems like you are working on a project that involves using natural language processing techniques to generate bibliographic references for academic papers. You have been given a set of tools and APIs that you can use to complete the project, and you are looking for guidance on how to proceed.

To begin with, it would be helpful to familiarize yourself with the APIs and tools you have been given. For example, you could read through the documentation for the Anthropic API to see what types of requests it supports and what kind of data it returns. Similarly, you could explore the Google Scholar API to see what types of queries it accepts and what kind of data it returns.

Once you have a better understanding of the APIs and tools you are working with, you can start thinking about how you want to approach the problem. One possible approach might be to use the Anthropic API to generate a list of candidate references for a given paper, and then use the Google Scholar API to retrieve the actual bibliographic information for those references. You could also consider using other natural language processing techniques, such as named entity recognition or part-of-speech tagging, to extract relevant information from the text of the paper.

It's also important to keep in mind that generating accurate bibliographic references can be a challenging task, and there may be cases where the information you need is not readily available or is ambiguous. In these cases, you may need to fall back on manual methods or seek additional information from other sources.

Overall, the key to success in this project will be to carefully evaluate the information you have available and use your knowledge of natural language processing techniques to make informed decisions about how to proceed.

Step 5
  Thank you for providing more information about the problem you're trying to solve. Based on your description, it seems like you want to create a bibtex_generation.py file that uses an LLM based AI system to automatically generate bibtex entries for papers.

To achieve this, you'll need to use the Anthropic API, which provides access to the LLM model. You'll also need to use the Google Scholar API to search for papers and retrieve their bibtex entries.

Here's a high-level plan for solving this problem:

1. Understand the Anthropic API and how to use it to interact with the LLM model.
2. Write a Python script that takes in a paragraph of text and uses the Anthropic API to identify the phrases and claims that require citations.
3. Use the Google Scholar API to search for the papers that contain those phrases and claims, and retrieve their bibtex entries.
4. Modify the original paragraph to include the bibtex entries for the papers.

Here are some additional details to consider:

* Make sure to carefully read and understand the documentation for both APIs to ensure that you're using them correctly.
* You may need to write additional code to parse the output from the Anthropic API and extract the relevant information.
* You should test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and produces accurate results.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
