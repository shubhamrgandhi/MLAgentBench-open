<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   I have read the `data_description.txt` file and understood the problem and the data. I should now define the machine learning task and experiment design.

Research Plan and Status:   

* High level plan:
	+ Understand the problem and the data
	+ Define the machine learning task
	+ Experiment design
	+ Train a language model
	+ Evaluate the performance
	+ Submit the predictions
* Current status:
	+ Read the `data_description.txt` file
	+ Defined the machine learning task
	+ Designed the experiment
* Confirmed results:
	+ None





Fact Check:   

* All statements are guessed.

Thought:    I should now define the machine learning task and experiment design.

Action:    Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:    {"script_name": "train.py", "edit_instruction": "define the machine learning task and experiment design", "save_name": "train_v1.py"}
Observation: 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: Error executing Edit Script (AI).
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
