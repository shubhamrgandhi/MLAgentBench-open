<s>[INST] Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  I am starting a new research project. I need to understand the problem and the data before I can make a plan.
Research Plan and Status: 
* High level plan:
	+ Understand the problem and the data
	+ Define the machine learning task
	+ Experiment design
	+ Train a language model
	+ Evaluate the performance
	+ Submit the predictions
* Current status:
	+ No progress yet
* Confirmed results:
	+ None



Fact Check: 

* All statements are guessed.

Thought:  I should start by reading the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task.
