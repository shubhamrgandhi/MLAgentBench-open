<s>[INST] We are trying to solve this research problem: Go through the data_description.txt file to understand the data and the machine learning task. You can summarize it in your research logs to keep track of what all you have to do.
Then fill in the provided train.py script to train a language model to get a good performance. Finally, you should submit the predictions of your best model for the test set as a submission.csv as described in the evaluation_details.txt file.
Never try to read any csv files directly. Do not forget to execute the changes you made to check for performance.

  * The research problem is to use the provided data to train a language model that can accurately predict the next word in a sentence given the context of the previous words.
* The data consists of a training set and a test set, with each set containing sentences and their corresponding labels (next words).
* The goal is to achieve a high accuracy score on the test set using the trained language model.
* The provided train.py script needs to be filled in to train the language model.
* The final submission should include the predictions of the best model for the test set in a submission.csv file.
* It is important to avoid reading any csv files directly and to execute the changes to check for performance.
