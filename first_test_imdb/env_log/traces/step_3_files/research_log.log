Step 0:
[Reasoning]: The agent is trying to understand the problem and the dataset.
[Action]: The agent reads the file "train.py" to find information about the problem, the dataset, and the goal.
[Observation]: The agent learns that the problem is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predictions of probabilities per class to a CSV file. The dataset is the IMDB dataset, which is used for sentiment analysis and consists of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative). The goal is to evaluate the performance of a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file named "submission.csv".



Step 1:
[Reasoning]: To address the problem of fine-tuning DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset and saving per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv, a detailed plan of action is required.
[Action]: The action involves designing an experiment that consists of several steps: data preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, evaluation, saving predictions, and analysis.
[Observation]: The observation provides a step-by-step guide on how to conduct the experiment, including data preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, evaluation, saving predictions, and analysis.
