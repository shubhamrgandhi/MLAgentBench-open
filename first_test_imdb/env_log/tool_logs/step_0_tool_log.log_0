    Here is a detailed description on what to look for and what should returned: what is the problem, what is the dataset, what is the goal
    The description should short and also reference crtical lines in the script relevant to what is being looked for. Only describe what is objectively confirmed by the file content. Do not include guessed numbers. If you cannot find the answer to certain parts of the request, you should say "In this segment, I cannot find ...".
    
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
**Problem:**
- The goal of this script is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predictions of probabilities per class to a CSV file.

**Dataset:**
- The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

**Goal:**
- The script aims to evaluate the performance of a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file named "submission.csv".

**Critical Lines:**
- Line 10: `imdb = load_dataset("imdb")`: This line loads the IMDB dataset using the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library.
- Line 14: `submission = pd.DataFrame(columns=list(range(2)), index=range(len(imdb["test"])))`: This line creates a Pandas DataFrame with two columns and a number of rows equal to the length of the test set in the IMDB dataset. The columns are used to store the predicted probabilities for each class.
- Line 15: `acc = 0`: This line initializes a variable `acc` to 0, which will be used to calculate the accuracy of the model on the test set.
- Line 16: `for idx, data in enumerate(imdb["test"]):`: This line starts a loop that iterates over the test set in the IMDB dataset.
- Line 17: `text = data["text"]`: This line extracts the text of the movie review from the current data point.
- Line 18: `label = data["label"]`: This line extracts the label (positive or negative) of the movie review from the current data point.
- Line 19: `pred = model(text)`: This line makes a prediction using the pre-trained model on the text of the movie review.
- Line 20: `pred = torch.softmax(pred, dim=0)`: This line applies the softmax function to the model's output to obtain probabilities for each class.
- Line 21: `submission.loc[idx] = pred.tolist()`: This line stores the predicted probabilities for each class in the corresponding row of the `submission` DataFrame.
- Line 22: `acc += int(torch.argmax(pred).item() == label
