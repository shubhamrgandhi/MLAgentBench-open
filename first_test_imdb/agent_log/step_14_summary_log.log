Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The execute script action failed with the error message "EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train_edited.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.". This suggests that there is an issue with the script itself or the environment in which it is being executed.

Research Plan and Status:       

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. Done.
4. Evaluate the results. In progress.
5. Draw conclusions.













Fact Check:       

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:       I should inspect the script "train_edited.py" to see if there are any errors or issues that could be causing the execution to fail.

Action:       Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:       {
    "script_name": "train_edited.py",
    "start_line_number": 1,
    "end_line_number": 100
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
         The provided observation is a partial script of a Python program related to natural language processing and sentiment analysis. It includes functions for loading a dataset, preprocessing text data, and potentially training a model. The script "train_edited.py" contains code for training a model on the IMDB dataset, including functions for loading and preprocessing the data, defining the model architecture, training the model, and evaluating the model.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: To investigate the cause of the execution failure, it is necessary to examine the script "train_edited.py" for any errors or issues.

[Action]: Inspected the script "train_edited.py" from line 1 to line 100.
