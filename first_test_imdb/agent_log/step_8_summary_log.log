===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The inspect script lines action shows that the first 10 lines of the script "train_edited.py" import necessary libraries and define a function named "main". This suggests that the error is likely not in the first 10 lines of the script.

Research Plan and Status:     

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. Done.
4. Evaluate the results. In progress.
5. Draw conclusions.







Fact Check:     

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:     I should inspect the rest of the script "train_edited.py" to find the error.

Action:     Inspect Script Lines
Action Input:     {
    "script_name": "train_edited.py",
    "start_line_number": 11,
    "end_line_number": 20
}
 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        Here are the lines (the file ends at line 9):


        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
        
===================gemini-pro response (500)=====================
[Reasoning]: The previous observation suggests that the error is not in the first 10 lines of the script "train_edited.py". Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the rest of the script to find the error.
[Action]: Inspected lines 11 to 20 of the script "train_edited.py".
[Observation]: The provided observation shows that the file ends at line 9, so there are no lines 11 to 20 to inspect.
