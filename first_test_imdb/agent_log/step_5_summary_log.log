===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:   The undo edit script action failed with the error message "EnvError: There is no change to undo." This means that the script "train_edited.py" was not edited in the first place.

Research Plan and Status:  

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. In progress.
4. Evaluate the results.
5. Draw conclusions.





Fact Check:  

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:   I should implement the experiment again.

Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "implement the experiment design",
    "save_name": "train_edited.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
         The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file. The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative). The experiment design has been completed and the implementation is in progress. The script "train.py" is edited to implement the experiment design and saved as "train_edited.py".

        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.

[Reasoning]: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file. The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative). The experiment design has been completed and the implementation is in progress.

[Action]: Edited the script "train.py" to implement the experiment design and saved it as "train_edited.py".

[Observation]: The script "train_edited.py" was created by editing "train.py" to implement the experiment design.
