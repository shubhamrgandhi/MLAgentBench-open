Reflection:   The undo edit script action failed with the error message "EnvError: There is no change to undo." This means that the script "train_edited.py" was not edited in the first place.

Research Plan and Status:  

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. In progress.
4. Evaluate the results.
5. Draw conclusions.





Fact Check:  

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:   I should implement the experiment again.

Action:   Edit Script (AI)
Action Input:   {
    "script_name": "train.py",
    "edit_instruction": "implement the experiment design",
    "save_name": "train_edited.py"
}

The full observation is too long. 
Given summaries for each segments of the whole observation, summarize to get a cohesive description of the entire observation.
Segment {idx}: 

[Observation]: The script "train.py" is edited to implement the experiment design and saved as "train_edited.py". The diff of the edited script is provided for review.
