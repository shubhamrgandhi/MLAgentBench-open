===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:  The script "train_edited.py" failed to execute with the error message "EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train_edited.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed." This error is likely caused by an issue with the script itself or the environment in which it is being executed.

Research Plan and Status: 

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. Done.
4. Evaluate the results. In progress.
5. Draw conclusions.



Fact Check: 

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:  I should debug the script "train_edited.py" to fix the error and then execute it to evaluate the results.

Action:  Undo Edit Script
Action Input:  {
    "script_name": "train_edited.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: There is no change to undo.
        ```
