===================prompt=====================
Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:    The edit script (AI) action successfully implemented the experiment design and saved the edited script as "train_edited.py".

Research Plan and Status:   

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. Done.
4. Evaluate the results.
5. Draw conclusions.







Fact Check:   

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:    I should now execute the script "train_edited.py" to evaluate the results.

Action:    Execute Script
Action Input:    {
    "script_name": "train_edited.py"
} 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train_edited.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.
        ```
        Summarize your action and the observation in this format:
        [Reasoning]: Summarize the reasoning behind the action
        [Action]: Summarize all relevant details of the action objectively
        [Observation]: Summarize all relevant details in the observation objectively
        Do not include any result that is guessed rather than directly confirmed by the observation. Do not include additional information or suggestions.
