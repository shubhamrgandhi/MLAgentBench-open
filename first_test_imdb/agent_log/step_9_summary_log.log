Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:     The inspect script lines action shows that the script "train_edited.py" ends at line 9, so there are no lines 11 to 20 to inspect. This means that the error is not in the script itself.

Research Plan and Status:     

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. Done.
4. Evaluate the results. In progress.
5. Draw conclusions.









Fact Check:     

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:     I should check the environment in which the script "train_edited.py" is being executed to see if there is an issue there.
