Given your action and the observation: 
        Reflection:       The copy file action succeeded with the message "File backup/train.py_2024-01-04_01-14-28 copied to train.py". This suggests that the file "train.py" now exists in the current directory.

Research Plan and Status:       

1. Understand the problem and the dataset. Done.
2. Design an experiment to address the problem. Done.
3. Implement the experiment. Done.
4. Evaluate the results. In progress.
5. Draw conclusions.













Fact Check:       

- Guessed: The goal is to evaluate a pre-trained model on the IMDB dataset and save the predicted probabilities for each class to a CSV file.
- Directly confirmed: The IMDB dataset is used for sentiment analysis, consisting of movie reviews with binary labels (positive or negative).

Thought:       I should execute the script "train_edited.py" to start the experiment.

Action:       Execute Script
Action Input:       {
    "script_name": "train_edited.py"
}

 
        [Observation]:
        ```
        EnvError: Something went wrong in executing train_edited.py: [WinError 10038] An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket. Please check if it is ready to be executed.
        ```
