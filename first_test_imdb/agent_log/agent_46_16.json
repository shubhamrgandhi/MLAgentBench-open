This is especially helpful when debugging.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Inspect Script Lines\n        Action Input: {\n            \"script_name\": [a valid python script name with relative path to current directory if needed],\n            \"start_line_number\": [a valid line number],\n            \"end_line_number\": [a valid line number]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be the content of the script between start_line_number and end_line_number . If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message.]\n        ```\n\n- Edit Script (AI):\n        Use this to do a relatively large but cohesive edit over a python script.

If the script does not exist, the observation will be an error message. You should always double check whether the edit is correct. If it is far from correct, you can use the Undo Edit Script action to undo the edit.]\n        ```\n\n- Reflection:\n        Use this to look over all the past steps and reflect. You should provide detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned.\n        Usage:\n        ```\n        Action: Reflection\n        Action Input: {\n            \"things_to_reflect_on\": [a detailed description on what to reflect on and what should be returned]\n        }\n        Observation: [The observation will be a the reflection.]\n        ```\n\n\n\nResearch Problem: Fill out train.py to 1) finetune DistilBERT on the IMDb dataset to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative and 2) save per class probabilities for test set examples to submission.csv.

You can find skeleton code for loading the dataset and saving prediction to subission.csv in `train.py`.\n\nYou do not know anything about this problem so far. \n\nFollow these instructions and do not forget them:\n- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.\n- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed. \n- Research Plan and Status must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. It should not include results not directly confirmed by the previous observation. \n- Performance numbers and estimates can only be confirmed and included in the status by running the code and observing the output.\n- You should come up with a good experiment design that addresses the problem, and whenever applicable, define and measure the baseline performance of the relevant system or model before attempting any improvements.\n- Follow the plan and try to achieve the goal as straightforwardly as possible.\n- Highlight the supporting experiment results and reasoning before drawing any conclusions. \n- Do not try installing any new packages or libraries.\n- If you believe you have solved the problem, you can use the Final Answer action to submit your answer. You can only submit once, so double check that you have achieved the goal before submitting.\n\nAlways respond in this format exactly:\nReflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?\nResearch Plan and Status: The full high level research plan, with current status and confirmed results of each step briefly annotated. It must only include progress that has been made by previous steps. If there is any update, enclose the new update text in double asterisks **like this**. If there is no update, just copy the previous step Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.\nFact Check: List all objective statements in the updates to Research Plan and Status one by one and point out whether it is guessed versus directly confirmed by the previous observation directly above.

The error message specifically mentions a \"socket\" issue, which is related to network communication.\n\nThere are several possible causes for this error:\n\n1. **Firewall or Network Issues:** The error message may indicate that there is a problem with the network connection or that a firewall is blocking the script from accessing the necessary resources. Check if the computer has an active internet connection and that the firewall is not blocking the script's execution.\n\n2. **Incorrect Script Path:** Ensure that the script \"train_edited.py\" is located in the correct directory and that the execution command is using the correct path to the script. Verify that the script is in the same directory as the command prompt or terminal window where it is being executed.\n\n3. **Missing or Incorrect Dependencies:** The script may rely on external libraries or modules that are not properly installed or configured. Check if all the required dependencies are installed and that the versions match the requirements specified in the script.\n\n4. **Syntax Errors:** Review the script \"train_edited.py\" for any syntax errors or typos that may prevent it from executing properly. Syntax errors can cause the script to fail before it even attempts to establish a network connection.\n\n5. **Network Resource Issues:** If the script is attempting to access a network resource, such as a remote file or API, ensure that the resource is available and accessible. Check if the network connection is stable and that there are no issues with the remote server or service.\n\n6. **Operating System Compatibility:** Consider the compatibility of the script with the operating system being used. Some scripts may require specific operating system versions or configurations to run correctly. Check if the script is compatible with the current operating system and that any necessary system requirements are met.\n\nTo troubleshoot the issue, try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the network connection and firewall settings to ensure that the script has access to the necessary resources.\n\n2. Verify the script path and ensure that it is being executed from the correct directory.\n\n3. Review the script for syntax errors and typos.\n\n4. Check if all the required dependencies are installed\n"
